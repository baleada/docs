    "body": "Baleada Gesture is a tiny [factory function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImwrezYhw4w) that helps you define custom [gestures](#what-is-a-gesture).\n\nThe function returns an API—more specifically, a JavaScript object with useful properties and methods that will help you handle DOM events and recognize gestures.\n\n\n:::\n## A note, before you dive in\n:::\n\nBaleada Gesture was designed and written during the development of the [`Listenable`](/docs/logic/classes/listenable) class in Baleada Logic, and [Baleada Listenable Gestures](/docs/listenable-gestures) is built on top of Baleada Gesture to help you listen for the following gestures in your project:\n- clicks (for recognizing single clicks, double clicks, or any other number of clicks)\n- drag\n- dragdrop\n- pan\n- pinch\n- press\n- rotate\n- swipe\n- taps (for recognizing single taps, double taps, or any other number of taps)\n\nBefore you use Baleada Gesture to define your own custom gestures, it's recommended that you check out the `Listenable` docs and the Baleada Listenable Gestures docs, and see how those tools work together. If you're satisfied with that workflow, and agree with the way the gestures are defined and recognized, you may not need to use Baleada Gesture at all.\n\nBut, if you don't agree with the way Baleada Listenable Gestures defines certain gestures, or if you want to add a new custom gesture, Baleada Gesture lays a great foundation that you can build upon!\n\n\n:::\n## What is a \"gesture\"?\n:::\n\nIn the context of Baleada Gesture, a \"gesture\" is defined as a sequence of DOM events that can be recognized as something more abstract. For example, a \"swipe\" gesture is:\n- A single touch,\n- that starts at a given point,\n- travels a distance greater than 0px (or a minimum distance of your choice),\n- travels at a velocity of greater than 0px/ms (or a minimum velocity of your choice),\n- does not cancel,\n- and finally, ends.\n\nThis sequence involves the [`touchstart`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchstart_event), [`touchmove`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchmove_event), [`touchcancel`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchcancel_event), and [`touchend`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchend_event) events. If those events happen in a particular order, and if their combined event data meets the conditions listed above, then the entire sequence of events can be considered one \"swipe\".\n\n\n:::\n## Installation\n:::\n\n:::\n```bash\nnpm i @baleada/gesture\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Usage\n:::\n\n:::\n### Import the factory function\n:::\n\nTo get started, import the `gesture` factory function from Baleada Gesture's entry file:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### Create your factory function\n:::\n\nAfter you import `gesture`, define your own factory function for your custom gesture:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  ...\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### Build your objects\n:::\n\nAt the bottom of your factory function, use the `gesture` function to create a gesture API with useful properties and methods ([more on this later](#gesture-object-properties-and-methods)), and create the object you'll be returning from your function. You'll be passing an options object to the `gesture` function, but we'll handle that part later.\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  // We'll be putting other code here\n\n  const api = gesture({ ... }),\n        object = {\n          // Add properties, methods, getters, setters, etc.\n        }\n\n  return object\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### Define your event handlers\n:::\n\nWith your objects defined at the bottom, start defining functions at the top. These functions will handle incoming DOM events, extract any metadata you need, and determine whether or not the full sequence of events matches the definition of your custom recognizer.\n\nYou can name these functions anything, but the best practice is to name them after the type of event they will be handling:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  function touchstart () {\n    ...\n  }\n  function touchmove () {\n    ...\n  }\n  function touchcancel () {\n    ...\n  }\n  function touchend () {\n    ...\n  }\n\n  const api = gesture({ ... }),\n        object = { ... }\n  return object\n}\n```\n:::\n\nFrom inside your functions, you can freely access your gesture API:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  function touchstart () {\n     console.log(api.events) // This works, because in practice, the function won't run until after the gesture API has been defined\n  }\n\n  ...\n\n  const api = gesture({ ... }),\n        object = { ... }\n  return object\n}\n```\n:::\n\nBelow is a full breakdown of the properties and methods included with the gesture API.\n\n:::\n### Gesture API properties and methods\n:::\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Gesture API properties and methods\" canFilterByQuery\n\n| Property | Type | Description | Parameters | Return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `status` | Getter | See return value | N/A | The current status (String) of the instance. `status` is always `'ready'`, `'recognizing'`, or `'recognized'`. |\n| `handle(event)` | Function | <p>Interprets the type of its `event` parameter and calls the matching method on your subclass.</p> <p>`handle` also calls the `reset` method (details below) IF `status` is `'recognized'` AND the `gesture` constructor's `recognizesConsecutive` option is `false`.</p> <p>`handle` also adds its `event` parameter to the `events` array (details below) and will remove events from that array IF the `gesture` constructor's `maxSequenceLength` option is a number AND the events array's length is greater than that number.</p> | N/A | `status` |\n| `events` | Getter | See return value | N/A | The events (Array) that have been passed to the `handle` method |\n| `lastEvent` | Getter | See return value | N/A | The last event (Event) in the `events` array |\n| `recognized()` | Function | Sets `status` to `'recognized'` | none | none |\n| `reset()` | Function | Sets `events` to an empty array, `lastEvent` to `undefined`, `status` to `'ready'`, and calls the optional `onReset` function, if available ([see below](#gesture-factory-options) for more info on the optional `onReset` function). | none | none |\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### Pass your event handlers to the gesture factory\n:::\n\nWhen you're satisfied with the functions you've defined, return to the `gesture` function's optional parameter, which is an object. Add a `handlers` property to the object. The value of the `handlers` property should be an object. The keys of the object should be the names of the DOM events you'll be listening to, and the values should be the functions you wrote previously to handle the events.\n\nIf you named your functions after the DOM events they handle, you can easily destructure them into your `handlers` object:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  function touchstart () { ... }\n  function touchmove () { ... }\n  function touchcancel () { ... }\n  function touchend () { ... }\n\n  const api = gesture({\n          handlers: { touchstart, touchmove, touchcancel, touchend }\n        }),\n        object = { ... }\n  return object\n}\n```\n:::\n\nInternally, your gesture API uses the `handlers` option to make sure all events are routed to the correct handler, so that your gesture-identifying logic runs properly.\n\n\n:::\n### Connect your object to the gesture API\n:::\n\nEach time a DOM event comes through, your gesture API will call the appropriate function defined in your `handlers` object, passing two arguments:\n1. The DOM event that just happened\n2. The \"handler API\". For more info on the handler API, [check out the full guide](/docs/gesture/handler-api).\n\nFor all of this to work, however, you need to make sure that events are being passed to your gesture API's `handle` method when they come through. You can connect these two objects however you like, but usually, the easiest way is to define a simple `handle` method on the object you'll be returning:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  ...\n  const api = gesture({ ... }),\n        object = {\n          handle: event => api.handle(event)\n        }\n  return object\n}\n```\n:::\n\nThe last thing you need to know is what other options the `gesture` function accepts so that you can customize the object you receive back. Here's a full breakdown:\n\n:::\n### Gesture factory options\n:::\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Gesture factory options\" canFilterByQuery\n| Option | Type | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `handlers` | Object | none | Passes key/value pairs, where each key is the name of a DOM event you want to listen to, and each value is the appropriate handler function you defined for that event. |\n| `recognizesConsecutive` | Boolean | `false` | <p>Indicates whether or not `gesture` should be able to recognize the same gesture multiple times in a row without calling its `reset` method.</p> <p>Keep it as `false` for gestures like \"swipe\" and \"drag-and-drop\", which have precise starting and ending points. Set it to `true` for gestures like \"pan\" or \"click-and-drag\", which can continue to occur after they are first recognized.</p> |\n| `maxSequenceLength` | Number | `false` | <p>Defines the maximum number of events that the `gesture` class will keep track of.</p> <p>If `maxSequenceLength` is a number greater than 0, `gesture` will remove the first event in the array each time the `maxSequenceLength` is exceeded. If `maxSequenceLength` is `false`, `gesture` will never remove events from the array.</p> |\n| `onReset` | Function | none | Passes a function that your gesture API will call each time its own `reset()` method is called. Your gesture API calls its own `reset()` method when its `status` is `'recognized'` and the `recognizesConsecutive` options is `false`. You can use the `onReset` option to hook into that function call and properly reset any variables you're using to store metadata about events. |\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Inspiration for your custom gestures\n:::\n\nFor inspiration and some examples of how Baleada Gesture is used in practice, check out the [Baleada Listenable Gesture source code](https://gitlab.com/baleada/listenable-gestures/tree/master/src/factories).\n\n\n:::\n## Language, compilation, browser support, and dependencies\n:::\n\nBaleada Gesture is written in modern JavaScript and compiled by [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to work in browsers that are used by more than 0.5% of global web visitors AND have had official support or updates in the past 24 months.\n\nTo allow for [tree-shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/), Baleada Gesture's compiled code has no side effects and uses [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [`export`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) instead of [`require()`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_id) and [`module.exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports).\n\nBaleada Gesture has no dependencies.\n",

    "body": "Honduras's favorite food is the **baleada**—a fresh flour tortilla, spread with refried beans, then decorated with scrambled eggs, mantequilla, queso seco, avocado, or meat, and finally folded in half.\n\nYou can't have a baleada without its core ingredients and presentation (tortilla spread with refried beans and folded in half), but once those requirements are met, you can be creative and combine ingredients that suit your tastebuds.\n\nAnyway, the Baleada you're here for is **a toolkit for building web apps** (and websites). Getting down to brass tacks, Baleada offers the following types of tools:\n- UI logic\n- Composition functions (a.k.a. hooks)\n- Components\n- Configuration utilities\n- More to come ([see roadmap](/docs/roadmap))\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nFeeling a little fuzzy on what these terms mean? Check out the guide on [types of tools](/docs/types-of-tools) for definitions.\n:::\n\nThink of these tools as the ingredients in a savory, delectable baleada. You're encouraged to take what you want and sprinkle it into the stack you're already using to build your apps and websites. You're free to take just a few things, but if you're so inclined, you can really pile on the extras!\n\nAll of the tools are listed in the sidebar on the left.\n\n<!-- :::\n## Who is Baleada designed for?\n:::\n\nBaleada is designed for developers who:\n- **Do** want to add common UI features and behaviors to their app, but **don't** want to think about implementation details.\n- **Do** value consistency and predictability in JavaScript library APIs.\n- **Do** care about performance, best practices, internationalization, accessibility, and security, but **haven't** had time to fine-tune this stuff in the past, because they've always been too busy hacking together a custom autocomplete component or another 🤬 carousel for the who-knows-how-many-th time.\n- **Do** appreciate the role React hooks and Vue composition functions play in making web dev easier and more inclusive.\n- **Do** appreciate [the benefits of using SVG over icon fonts](http://www.fullstackradio.com/47).\n- **Do** appreciate documentation that makes them hungry. -->\n<!-- - **Do** want a design system to govern their styles, but **don't** want their apps and sites to look like everyone else's. -->\n\n\n:::\n## Copyright and Licensing\n:::\n\nAll of Baleada's tools are copyrighted from 2019-present and licensed under the MIT license.\n",

    "body": "Baleada Linear Numeric is a function that returns theme configurations from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)'s [default config file](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/blob/master/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js), aliasing all class names so that they use a linear numeric naming convention.\n\nBy default, it produces class names like the following:\n- `.text-400` instead of `.text-base`\n- `.font-100` instead of `.font-hairline`\n- `.mt-800`, `.mt-900`, and `.mt-1000`, instead of `.mt-10`, `.mt-12`, and `.mt-16`\n\nIt can be customized to produce classes like `.text-4` instead of `.text-400`.\n\nIf you're familiar with the concept of a linear numeric naming convention in Tailwind, you can [jump to the Installation section](#installation). Otherwise, the next section has some helpful background info\n\n:::\n## WTF is a \"linear numeric naming convention\"?\n:::\n\nTailwind uses several different naming conventions for its utility classes.\n\nSome classes, like [transition duration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/transition-duration), use literal values from the underlying design system:\n- `duration-75` for `75ms`\n- `duration-100` for `100ms`\n- `duration-150` for `150ms`\n\n\nOther classes use \"T-shirt sizes\" in their class names. For example, here are the default [font size](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size) classes:\n- `.text-xs`\n- `.text-sm`\n- `.text-base`\n- `.text-lg`\n- `.text-xl`\n- `.text-2xl`\n- `.text-3xl`\n- `.text-4xl`\n- `.text-5xl`\n- `.text-6xl`\n\nOther classes, like the ones for font weight, use more semantic words:\n- `.font-hairline`\n- `.font-thin`\n- `.font-light`\n- `.font-normal`\n- `.font-medium`\n- `.font-semibold`\n- `.font-bold`\n- `.font-extrabold`\n- `.font-black`\n\nSpacing utilities ([margin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin), [padding](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding), [width](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width), [height](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/height), and [gap](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/gap)), use proportional numeric names. This means that the classes are suffixed with numbers that are proportional to the underlying values.\n\nSpacing utilities multiply the underlying `rem` value by 4 to derive the class name. Here are a few examples from the padding utilities:\n- `.p-1` for `0.25rem`\n- `.p-5` for `1.25rem`\n- `.p-24` for `6rem`\n- `.p-64` for `16rem`\n\nAnd finally, Tailwind's [color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/color) utilities use a **linear numeric naming convention**. This means that all class suffixes are numbers that increment linearly from one value to the next:\n- `.bg-blue-100`\n- `.bg-blue-200`\n- `.bg-blue-300`\n- `.bg-blue-400`\n- `.bg-blue-500`\n- `.bg-blue-600`\n- `.bg-blue-700`\n- `.bg-blue-800`\n- `.bg-blue-900`\n\n**Literal**, **T-shirt**, **semantic**, **proportional numeric**, and **linear numeric**—all of these naming conventions have their pros and cons. Baleada Linear Numeric will help you explore the pros and cons of linear numeric class names in your own projects.\n\n\n:::\n## Installation\n:::\n\nBaleada Linear Numeric can be installed from NPM:\n\n:::\n```bash\nnpm i @baleada/linear-numeric/tailwind --save-dev\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Usage\n:::\n\nTo get started, require `@baleada/linear-numeric/tailwind` in your [Tailwind config file](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration). The default export is a function, which we'll call `linearNumeric` in this example.\n\n:::\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst linearNumeric = require('@baleada/linear-numeric/tailwind')\n```\n:::\n\nThe `linearNumeric` returns configurations for the following properties of the `theme` object in your config file:\n- `spacing`\n- `borderRadius`\n- `borderWidth`\n- `boxShadow`\n- `fontSize`\n- `fontWeight`\n- `letterSpacing`\n- `lineHeight`\n- `maxWidth`\n- `colors`\n- `strokeWidth`\n- `transition`\n\nThe function accepts one parameter: an object with options (none of which are required). Here's a full breakdown of that object:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"linearNumeric options schema\" classes=\"wide-4\"\n| Property | Value's type | Default | Value description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `only` | Array of Strings | An array of all the properties listed above | Indicates which properties' configurations should be returned by `linearNumeric`. |\n| `increment` | Number | `100` | <p>Determines how much the class name is incremented for each step up in size.</p><p>For example, if you pass `1` as the `increment`, you'll get class names like `.text-4` and `.text-5` instead of the default `.text-400` and `.text-500`.</p> |\n:::\n\nIf you want to use linear numeric naming for all of these properties, simply spread the output of `linearNumeric` into your config file.\n\n:::\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst linearNumeric = require('@baleada/linear-numeric/tailwind')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    ...linearNumeric() // Overrides the default theme (only the properties listed above)\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nIf you only want to use linear numeric naming for some properties, use the `only` option to restrict your list.\n\n:::\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst linearNumeric = require('@baleada/linear-numeric/tailwind')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    ...linearNumeric({ only: ['spacing'] }) // Overrides the default theme's spacing values, but you'll still get default classes (e.g. .shadow-md) for other properties\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nThe default configurations for margin, padding, height, width, and gap all reference your `spacing` object. Including `spacing` in your `linearNumeric` output will adjust all of those utility classes.\n:::\n\nTo customize the increment that gets used in your class names, use the `increment` option.\n\n:::\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst linearNumeric = require('@baleada/linear-numeric/tailwind')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    ...linearNumeric({ increment: 1 }) // Produces classes like .text-4 and .text-5 instead of the default .text-400 and .text-500\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nYou can call `linearNumeric` as many times as you want, so feel free to use the `only` and `increment` options to fine tune class names for individual properties.\n\n:::\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst linearNumeric = require('@baleada/linear-numeric/tailwind')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    ...linearNumeric({ only: ['fontSize'], increment: 1 }), // .text-4, .text-5, etc.\n    ...linearNumeric({ only: ['fontWeight'] }) // .font-400, .font-500, etc.\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nAlmost all configurations returned by `linearNumeric` are plain JavaScript objects, so you can typically spread them out alongside any additional custom values you want to add.\n\nJust remember that you'll have to tack on the property name after your function call to make sure you're spreading your desired configuration object, instead of the parent object `linearNumeric` returns.\n\n:::\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst linearNumeric = require('@baleada/linear-numeric/tailwind')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    borderWidth: {\n      '550': '3px',\n      ...linearNumeric({ only: ['borderWidth'] }).borderWidth, // Spreads in all the default borderWidth values\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nTo expand on that concept: `linearNumeric` returns a full colors object for the `colors` property. If you want to access a single color, you can tack on `.colors` and the color name right after your function call:\n\n:::\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst linearNumeric = require('@baleada/linear-numeric/tailwind')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    colors: {\n      blue: linearNumeric({ only: ['colors'], increment: 1 }).colors.blue, // .bg-blue-1, .bg-blue-2, etc.\n      gray: {\n        ...linearNumeric({ only: ['colors'] }).colors.gray, // .bg-gray-100, .bg-gray-200, etc.\n        '1000': 'hsla(217, 30%, 8%, 1.0)',\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe only property for which `linearNumeric` *doesn't* return a plain Javascript object is `maxWidth`.\n\nFor `maxWidth`, `linearNumeric` returns a function, just like the one found in [Tailwind's default config](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/blob/master/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js). To add additional values to your `maxWidth` config, you'll need to pass Tailwind's `theme` function and `configUtils` object to that function, using [Tailwind's closure syntax](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#referencing-other-values) like so:\n\n\n:::\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst linearNumeric = require('@baleada/linear-numeric/tailwind')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    maxWidth: (theme, configUtils) => ({\n      ...linearNumeric({ only: ['maxWidth'] }).maxWidth(theme, configUtils), // Generates and spreads in the maxWidth config object\n      '420': '420px',\n    }),\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Naming convention rules\n:::\n\nOk, so Baleada Linear Numeric uses linear numeric names—but where does the numbering start? How are \"default\" classes handled?\n\nBaleada Linear Numeric follows the rules below, in their exact order, to answer those questions individually for each property:\n1. Properties that already have linear numeric names (just color, at the moment) are not changed from their original naming scheme, except to support different increments using `linearNumeric`'s `increment` option.\n1. Anything with an underlying value of `0` or `none` (e.g. `.tracking-normal` and `shadow-none`) is named with the number `0`.\n\n    Then, starting at the `0` class, Baleada Linear Numeric increments in both directions, both negative and positive. Note that keys like `-100` in the config file will create classes like `.-tracking-100`.\n1. If there is no `0` value for the property, but there is a value assigned to a `default`, `normal`, or `base` key, Baleada Linear Numeric renames default/normal/base with `400`. This follows the CSS convention of using `400` for normal font weight.\n\n    Then, Baleada Linear Numeric increments in both directions from the `400` class. Note that this sometimes results in certain properties (e.g. `borderWidth`) having `400` classes, but not having classes for `100`, `200`, or `300`.\n\n    Tailwind's `.shadow-inner` is treated as a default negative shadow, and is assigned a key of `-400` (which produces the class `.-shadow-400`).\n1. Proportions (e.g. `full: 100%`), key words (e.g. `auto` and `outline`), and screen breakpoints (applicable for `max-width` utilities) are left unchanged.\n1. If the unit (e.g. `px`) is specified in the default Tailwind class, it's left unchanged.\n2. If a default Tailwind property includes a secondary set of values with different units, the Baleada Linear Numeric follows all the above rules to name those secondary values' classes, and finally includes the unit (and an extra hyphen) in the middle of the class name.\n\n    For example, default `lineHeight` values include both relative values (e.g. `1`, `1.25`, etc.) and fixed values using `rem` units (e.g. `1rem`, `1.25rem`, etc.). Baleada Linear Numeric follows all the above naming rules to name the relative and fixed values, then, to avoid naming collisions, adds `-rem-` to the middle of the class name for all `rem` values.\n\n    This produces classes like `.leading-300` (relative line height of `1.375`) and `.leading-rem-300` (fixed line height of `0.75rem`).\n\nOnce you get used to the naming convention, you'll find that classes become very easy to guess without visiting your config file or these docs.\n\nBut, if you have any doubts, check out the [class references](/docs/tailwind-linear/class-references) to see classes are being generated for each property, and how they match up with the original Tailwind classes.\n\nAlso, feel free to peruse the [full default config](/docs/tailwind-linear/default-config) returned by the `linearNumeric` function if you're curious about specific underlying values.\n\n\n:::\n## Language, compilation, browser support, and dependencies\n:::\n\nBaleada Linear Numeric is written in modern JavaScript, exported using CommonJS modules, and is not compiled. It's not designed to be used in the browser, but instead will most often be used in the Node environment where you are configuring Tailwind.\n\nBaleada Linear Numeric has no dependencies, although it does require Tailwind as a peer dependency.\n\n:::\n## Semantic versioning conventions\n:::\n\nIn Baleada Linear Numeric, the only thing that will ever trigger a new major version is a change to the underlying naming convention outlined above.\n\nFrom time to time, Tailwind's default config file changes, usually to support new properties, and sometimes to expand the design system and add values for existing properties. When this happens, any necessary updates to Baleada Linear Numeric will be released as a new minor version, even if the linear numeric naming convention gets applied in a different way.\n\nFor example, Tailwind 1.2 introduced a new value for the `borderRadius` property, between two existing values, and it also added the `transitionDuration` and `strokeWidth` properties (among others). In response, Baleada Linear Numeric was updated in the following ways:\n- Baleada Linear Numeric's `borderRadius.500` was changed to `borderRadius.600`, and the new value was inserted as `borderRadius.500`.\n- The `transitionDuration` and `strokeWidth` properties were added to the config object returned by Baleada Linear Numeric\n- Baleada Linear Numeric released a new minor version\n\nAfter Tailwind 1.2 was released, anyone using the `.rounded-500` class generated by Baleada Linear Numeric would have had to change all occurrences of that class to `.rounded-600` in their code. \n\nThis kind of impact is characteristic of a breaking change and a new major version. However, since it was a Tailwind design system change and not a change to the rules of the linear numeric naming convention, only a new minor version was released.\n",

An `options` object.\n\nThe `state` parameter is **always** required, and the `options` parameter is **always** optional. Given these parameters, the constructor **always** returns an instance of itself, which **always** takes the form of an Object with state and methods.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Example(state[, options])\n\ntypeof instance // -> 'object'\n```\n:::\n\nThe `state` parameter is **always** used to pass a piece of state whose core functionality will be enhanced by the class. The `options` parameter is **always** an Object that serves as a catch-all for **all** optional parameters that affect how a class behaves.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Example(state, {\n  optionalBooleanParam: true,\n  optionalStringParam: 'baleada',\n  optionalFunctionParam: thing => doThe(thing)\n})\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### Factory functions\n:::\n\nFactory functions accept two parameters:\n1. The piece of state that will be augmented with a new method prototype will be extended by the subclass.\n2. An `options` object.\n\nThe `state` parameter is **always** required, and the `options` parameter is **always** optional. Given these parameters, the constructor **always** returns the original `state` in Object form, with one new method added.\n\nFor example, if you pass a String, the factory will return a String object, just like you would get if you passed your string to `new String()`.\n\n:::\n```js\n// This example factory accepts a string\nconst instance = example('baleada')\n\ninstance instanceof String // -> true\ntypeof instance === 'string' // -> false\n\ninstance // -> { 0: \"b\", 1: \"a\", 2: \"l\", 3: \"e\", 4: \"a\", 5: \"d\", 6: \"a\", length: 7}\n`${instance}` // -> 'baleada'\ninstance.toString() // -> 'baleada'\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## How state and methods are made available to you\n:::\n\n:::\n### Class state and methods\n:::\n\nInstances of classes take the form of JavaScript Objects, and **all** state and methods are accessible through the properties of those objects.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Example(state)\n\ninstance.exampleState // Access state through properties\ninstance.exampleMethod() // Access methods through properties\n```\n:::\n\nClass instances' methods **always** return the instance itself. The main benefit of this is that you can use method chaining if needed.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Example(state)\n\ninstance.exampleMethod() // -> returns instance\ninstance\n  .exampleMethod()\n  .anotherMethod()\n  .yetAnotherMethod() // -> Works 👍 and returns instance\n```\n:::\n\n\nClass instances **always** store a version of their constructors' state in a public [getter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) named after the state's type (e.g. `string`, `array`, `keyframes`, etc.).\n\nClass instances **always** have a public method you can use to set a new value for that public getter. The method follows a naming convention of `set<PropertyName>` (e.g. `setString`, `setArray`, `setKeyframes`, etc.).\n\nThe `set<PropertyName>` methods have two benefits:\n1. Since they return the instance itself, you can method chain after updating your state\n2. Internally, they perform **any** and **all** side effects and validation that should happen before or after updating state, so that you don't have to be concerned with those things.\n\n:::\n```js\n// The Searchable class's constructor accepts an Array\nconst instance = new Searchable(['Baleada', 'Logic', 'Composition', 'Icons'])\n\ninstance.candidates // -> ['Baleada', 'Logic', 'Composition', 'Icons']\ninstance.setCandidates(['tortilla', 'beans', 'egg', 'avocado']) // updates the Searchable instance's candidates and its `trie` property, and returns the Searchable instance\ninstance.candidates  // -> ['tortilla', 'beans', 'egg', 'avocado']\n```\n:::\n\nIf you _don't_ need to method chain after updated your state, but you _do_ want to feel confident that side effects are performed correctly, you can simply assign a new value directly to the getter property. These getter properties also have their own [setters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) that pass your new value the `set<PropertyName>` method, ensuring that side effects and validation are performed.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Searchable(['Baleada', 'Logic', 'Composition', 'Icons'])\ninstance.candidates = ['tortilla', 'beans', 'egg', 'avocado'] // Internally, the setter updates candidates performs the side effect of updating the `trie` property\ninstance.candidates // -> ['tortilla', 'beans', 'egg', 'avocado']\n```\n:::\n\nSome classes, particularly those that were designed to capture text input from your end users, create additional public getters that you'll frequently need to update.\n\nThose public getters follow **all** of the same rules:\n- They each have a public method you can use to assign a new value to the property and perform necessary side effects and validation\n- Those methods follow the same  `set<PropertyName>` naming convention\n- If you assign a value to the property directly, its setter will still perform necessary side effects\n\n:::\n```js\n// The Completeable class's constructor accepts a String\nconst instance = new Completeable('Baleada')\n\ninstance.string // -> 'Baleada'\ninstance.location // -> 0\n\ninstance.setString('tortilla') // --> returns instance\n// OR\ninstance.string = 'tortilla' // Works just fine 👍\n\n\ninstance.setLocation('3') // --> returns instance\n// OR\ninstance.location = 3 // Works just fine 👍\n```\n:::\n\n\n**All** class instances also have one or more non-editable public getters. These getter properties share the following important characteristics:\n1. They allow you to access state that is useful for building certain UI features, but is not part of the core functionality or benefit of the class.\n2. **All** updates to the getter properties are considered side effects of other public methods.\n3. You'll **never** find a situation where it would make sense for you to edit the property directly. You'll **always** rely on the instance to manage the properties' values, updating it after other methods are called.\n4. When applicable, getter functions' behavior can be customized using properties in the `options` object that gets passed to the class constructor.\n\n:::\n```js\n// The Animateable class's constructor accepts an array of keyframes\nconst instance = new Animateable(myKeyframes, myOptions)\n\ninstance.play() // Plays the animation (and returns the instance)\ninstance.progress.time // -> A number between 0 and 1 indicating the time progress of the animation. Updated at 60fps.\ninstance.progress.time = 3 // Doesn't work (and shouldn't work!)\n```\n:::\n\nSome classes have side effects in the DOM that need to be cleaned up in order to avoid memory leaks. **All** of these classes have a public `stop` method that you can use to clean up.\n\n:::\n```js\n// Listenable can be used to listen to DOM events, media queries, Observer entries, and window idle periods.\nconst instance = new Listenable(myEventType)\n\ninstance.listen(myCallback) // Adds event listeners, connects observers, etc.\n\ninstance.stop() // Removes all listeners, disconnects all observers, etc.\n```\n:::\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nIf you use [Baleada Composition](/docs/composition) to bring Balaeda Logic into a React, Vue, or Svelte component, all side effects will be cleaned up for you automatically at the end of the component's lifecycle.\n\nSo, when you're using Baleada Composition, you never need to call the `stop` method unless you want to clean up side effects somewhere in the middle of a component's lifecycle.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n### Factory state and methods\n:::\n\nObjects returned by Baleada Logic's factories **never** have public state; they **always** have one method.\n\nFactory functions **never** directly mutate the original state they receive. They **always** follow three main steps:\n1. Create a copy of the original state (it's a deep copy of everything except objects inside Arrays or Maps)\n2. Add a new method onto the copy\n3. Return the copy\n\nFurthermore, the method added by factory functions always has the following characteristics:\n1. It **never** mutates the original object it was called on\n2. It **always** creates a new, mutated copy of the object it was called on\n3. It **always** passes the mutated copy back to the factory function and returns that value\n\n:::\n```js\n// renameable is a factory function that allows a Map to easily rename one of its keys\nconst originalMap = new Map([['one', 'value'], ['two', 'value']]),\n      renameableMap = renameable(originalMap),\n      renamedMap = renameableMap.rename({ from: 'one', to: 'uno' })\n\noriginalMap // -> [['one', 'value'], ['two', 'value']]\nrenamedMap // -> [['uno', 'value'], ['two', 'value']]\ntypeof result.rename === 'function' // -> true\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Why classes & factories provide certain state and methods\n:::\n\nBaleada Logic follows a consistent process for determing which state and methods are provided by classes:\n1. Identify one action or several related actions that would be useful in a user interface. These actions become methods on the class.\n1. Identify the piece(s) of state that the action will be performed on. In other words, answer the question, \"If this method were a standalone function, what would be a required argument?\" Each answer to that question becomes a public, writeable property on the class.\n2. Identify the piece(s) of state that would be useful for building certain UI features with the class' methods and public properties, but shouldn't be considered part of the core functionality or benefit of the class. Each identified piece of state becomes a getter on the class.\n\n\n\n:::\n## Why constructors accept certain state types and options\n:::\n\n:::\n## Constructors' state types\n:::\n\nBaleada Logic uses a sentence template to decide what state type (e.g. String, Array, HTMLElement, etc.) should be accepted by a constructor:\n\n:::\n```\nA `<state type>` can be `<action>`ed (by `<action arguments>`).\n```\n:::\n\nFor example, the `Searchable` class' core action is to search/fuzzy search an array of search candidates. The `Searchable` constructor's `state` parameter is the array of candidates, and the class has a `search` method that accepts a search query as its only argument. This fits into the sentence template nicely:\n\n:::\n```\n**Search candidates** can be **searched** by a **query**.\n```\n:::\n\nSome classes and factories have core actions that don't take arguments—in those cases, the last part of the sentence template is omitted. Take the `markupable` factory for example:\n\n:::\n```text\n**Markdown** (String) can be **marked up**.\n```\n:::\n\nAnd some classes have core actions that are actually private methods on the class, with more specific public methods that call the core private method under the hood. The `Animateable` class is a great example—it's constructor accepts an array of keyframes, and in order to animate those keyframes, it internally calls a private `animate` method when you call one of its more specific public methods: `play`, `reverse`, `seek`, or `restart`.\n\nThese types of classes still use that core action in their sentence template, even though it's accessed via a private method that you'll never use:\n\n:::\n```text\n**Keyframes** (Array) can be **animated**.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis sentence template ensures that **all** classes' and factories' methods are affordances. In other words, methods tell you what you can do with a given type of state, rather than what that type of state can do to itself or other things.\n\nIn the documentation for each individual library and subclass, you can find the filled-out sentence template, explaining why each class and subclass accepts its specific state type.\n\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nThe inspiration and motivation for this sentence template came from [Adam Wathan's \"Resisting Complexity\" talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfgtKb-VpRk).\n:::\n\n:::\n## Constructors' options\n:::\n\nConstructors only accept options that:\n- Initialize public properties\n- Customize the behavior of getter functions\n- Pass the `on<Method>` callback functions described earlier in this article\n\nConstructors **never** accept options that customize the behavior of public methods, they **always** allow those options to be passed to the method itself as a parameter.\n\n\n:::\n## Naming conventions\n:::\n\nClasses and factories are named after their core action, suffixed with `able`. Class names are proper-cased, and factory names are all lowercase.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Comparison of classes' and factories' core actions and names\"\n| Core action | Type | Name |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| search | class | `Searchable` |\n| listen | class | `Listenable` |\n| navigate | class | `Navigateable` |\n| copy | class | `Copyable` |\n| reorder | factory | `reorderable` |\n| delete | factory | `deleteable` |\n:::\n\nNote that in correct English grammar, the `-able` form of a word is not always this simple. There are a number of ways the grammar can be more complex:\n- Often (but not always), when a word ends in `e`, the `e` is ommitted before adding `able`\n- Words that end in `y` usually change the `y` to an `i` before adding `able`\n- Some words omit several letters from the end of the word before adding `able`\n\nInstead of relying on you to know all these rules of English grammar, Baleada Logic simply breaks them in favor of consistency and predictability. In Baleada Logic classes and factories, the name is **always** just the core action followed by `able`—no strange word modification, no guessing about whether or not the `e` is excluded before `able`, no replacing `y` with `i`, etc.\n\nIn the table below, you can explore some examples of core actions, class/factory names, and their proper English counterparts:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Comparison of classes' and factories' core actions, names, and proper English counterparts\" classes=\"wide-4\"\n| Core action | Class/factory name | Proper English name | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| search | `Searchable` | Searchable | Easy one! The proper English version is the same. |\n| copy | `Copyable` | Copiable | Proper English changes `y` to `i` before `able` 🤢 |\n| delete | `deleteable` | deletable | Proper English removes the `e` before `able` 😠 |\n| rename | `renameable` | renameable | Oh, this one ends in `e` too? Proper English says \"f*ck it, leave it in\" 🤬 |\n| navigate | `Navigateable` | Navigable | Proper English removes `ate` and just uses the stem `Navig` before adding `able` 🤮 |\n| reorder | `reorderable` | reorderable | Phew, another easy one! Proper English plays nice here. |\n:::\n\nIn conclusion, English grammar is annoying, so Baleada Logic ignores it and names everything using the `<core action>able` convention.\n\n:::\n> Proper English grammar is annoying. Baleada Logic's naming convention breaks its rules in favor of simplicity, consistency, and predictability.\n:::\n",

See the [How to format keyframes](#how-to-format-keyframes) section for more guidance on formatting the array. |\n| `options` | Object | no | Passes options for the `Animateable` instance. See the [`Animateable` constructor options](#Animateable-constructor-options) section for more guidance. |\n:::\n\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Animateable(keyframes[, options])\n```\n:::\n\nOr, if you're using [Baleada Composition](/docs/compositon):\n\n:::\n```js\nconst reactiveInstance = useAnimateable(keyframes[, options])\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### How to format keyframes\n:::\n\n`keyframes` is an Array, and each individual keyframe in the array is an Object. Keyframe objects can have the following properties:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Animateable keyframe format\" classes=\"wide-4\"\n| Property | Type | Required | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `progress` | Number | yes | <p>A number between `0` and `1` indicating the time through the animation sequence at which the keyframe occurs.</p><p>The `progress` property is exactly like percentage progress in CSS `@keyframe` animations, except that it's between `0` and `1` instead of `0` and `100`.</p> |\n| `data` | Object | yes | <p>Specifies properties and values for the keyframe, which `Animateable` will reference when computing frames between keyframes.</p><p>Each property can be any valid Object property. Properties are **not** required to be valid CSS properties.</p><p>Values can be Numbers, Strings, or Arrays. See the [How data types are animated](#How-data-types-are-animated) section for more guidance on how to format your values so that they get animated properly.</p> |\n| `timing` | Array | no | <p>Customizes the timing function used to compute frame data as progress is made toward the next keyframe.</p><p>See the [How to format timing](#how-to-format-timing) section for more guidance on formatting the `timing` array.</p><p>Just like the [`animation-timing-function` CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function), any `timing` specified on the last keyframe will have no effect.</p><p>If `timing` is not specified on the keyframe itself, `Animateable` will use the default timing function, which can be customized using the `timing` option in the constructor. See the [`Animateable` constructor options](#Animateable-constructor-options) section for more info about the global timing function.</p> |\n:::\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nYou don't have to order `keyframes` by `progress`. For example, you can list all the keyframes that animate a specific property, all the way from `progress: 0` to `progress: 1`. Then, in the same `keyframes` array, just list out the next set of keyframes that animate a different property from `progress: 0` to `progress: 1`.\n\nIt's also perfectly fine if the same `progress` value appears in multiple different keyframes in the array.\n\nInternally, `Animateable` sorts and analyze all keyframes to extract individual keyframe-to-keyframe property transitions, so feel free to organize keyframes in a way that makes sense to you!\n:::\n\n\n:::\n#### How data types are animated\n:::\n\nValues inside the `data` object of each keyframe can be Numbers, Strings, or Arrays. See the table below for more guidance on how each data type is handled when `Animateable` computes animation frames.\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"How data values are animated\"\n| When the value is a... | `Animateable`... |\n| --- | --- |\n| Number | Computes a number between the numbers of two consecutive keyframes, proportional to the time progress of the animation. |\n| String | <p>Strings are assumed to be colors in [hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet), [hsl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV), [rgb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model), or [lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space) format (you can use different formats across keyframes, even if it's the same property on your `data` object).</p><p>`Animateable` uses [the chroma.js `mix` method](https://vis4.net/chromajs/#chroma-mix) with `lrgb` color interpolation to compute a color between the colors of two consecutive keyframes. Just like with numbers, the computed color is proportional to the time progress of the animation.</p> |\n| Array | <p>Determines the lengths of the arrays in two consecutive keyframes, then computes a new length between those two lengths (exactly like it would compute any other number). Finally, `Animateable` [slices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) the array, starting from the `0` index and stopping at the computed index.</p><p>Just like with numbers and colors, the new length of the array is proportional to the time progress of the animation.</p> |\n:::\n\nTo ensure that all of these computations are proportional to the time progress of the animation, `Animateable` uses [BezierEasing](https://github.com/gre/bezier-easing) to compute the actual animation progress for any given time progress.\n\n\n::: type=\"warning\"\nEach individual property in your keyframes' `data` objects **must** contain the same data type across all keyframes.\n\nIt's not possible, for example, to set `myProperty` to a String in the first keyframe and a Number in the next keyframe. All values for `myProperty` must be the same data type.\n:::\n\n\n::: type=\"info\"\n**Why would I want to animate an array?**\n\nArray animations are designed to be an easy way to achieve the \"typewriter\" effect in your animation.\n\nSimply pass an empty array to the first keyframe (usually at progress `0`), and in subsequent keyframes, pass a string [split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) by empty quotes.\n\n`Animateable` will progressively lengthen your array throughout the animation, adding more characters onto the end of it. In each frame of the animation, you can [join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join) the array to rebuild the string, and set it as the `textContent` of a DOM element, and it will look like your string is being typed out across the screen.\n\nAdd custom timing functions as you see fit to make the \"typewriter\" feel more natural. \n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n#### How to format timing\n:::\n\nIn individual keyframes and in the `Animateable` constructor's `options` object, the `timing` property's value should be an Array of four Numbers. In order, those numbers should be:\n1. The `x` coordinate of the first control point\n2. The `y` coordinate of the first control point\n3. The `x` coordinate of the second control point\n4. The `y` coordinate of the second control point\n\nIn other words, the array should contain exactly what you would normally pass to the [`cubic-bezier()` function in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function).\n\nFor example:\n\n:::\n```js\n// This timing array produces the easeInOutQuad curve \n// from easings.net\n[\n  0.455, 0.030, // Point 1\n  0.515, 0.955, // Point 2\n]\n\n```\n:::\n\n`cubic-bezier()` examples abound on the internet, so it should be relatively easy to find and copy/paste control points. But for an even smoother experience, you can install the Baleada Animateable Timings package, which simply exports arrays of control points as variables.\n\n:::\n```bash\nnpm i @baleada/animateable-timings\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n```js\nimport { materialStandard } from '@baleada/animateable-timings'\n\nconst instance = new Animateable(\n  myKeyframes, \n  { timing: materialStandard }\n)\n```\n:::\n\nHere's a list of the available `timing` arrays in the package:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"List of timings in Baleada Animateable Timings\" classes=\"wide-3\"\n| Variable | Source | Coordinates |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `linear` | none | `0.00, 0.00, 1.00, 1.00`\n| `materialStandard` | [Material Design](https://material.io/design/motion/speed.html#easing) | `0.40, 0.00, 0.20, 1.00`\n| `materialDecelerated` | [Material Design](https://material.io/design/motion/speed.html#easing) | `0.00, 0.00, 0.20, 1.00`\n| `materialAccelerated` | [Material Design](https://material.io/design/motion/speed.html#easing) | `0.40, 0.00, 1.00, 1.00`\n| `verouEase` | [cubic-bezier.com](https://cubic-bezier.com/) | `0.25, 0.10, 0.25, 1.00`\n| `verouEaseIn` | [cubic-bezier.com](https://cubic-bezier.com/) | `0.42, 0.00, 1.00, 1.00`\n| `verouEaseOut` | [cubic-bezier.com](https://cubic-bezier.com/) | `0.00, 0.00, 0.58, 1.00`\n| `verouEaseInOut` | [cubic-bezier.com](https://cubic-bezier.com/) | `0.42, 0.00, 0.58, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInSine` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.12, 0.00, 0.39, 0.00`\n| `easingsNetOutSine` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.61, 1.00, 0.88, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInOutSine` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.37, 0.00, 0.63, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInQuad` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.11, 0.00, 0.50, 0.00`\n| `easingsNetOutQuad` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.50, 1.00, 0.89, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInOutQuad` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.45, 0.00, 0.55, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInCubic` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.32, 0.00, 0.67, 0.00`\n| `easingsNetOutCubic` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.33, 1.00, 0.68, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInOutCubic` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.65, 0.00, 0.35, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInQuart` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.50, 0.00, 0.75, 0.00`\n| `easingsNetInQuint` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.64, 0.00, 0.78, 0.00`\n| `easingsNetOutQuint` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.22, 1.00, 0.36, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInOutQuint` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.83, 0.00, 0.17, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInExpo` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.70, 0.00, 0.84, 0.00`\n| `easingsNetOutExpo` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.16, 1.00, 0.30, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInOutExpo` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.87, 0.00, 0.13, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInCirc` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.55, 0.00, 1.00, 0.45`\n| `easingsNetOutCirc` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.00, 0.55, 0.45, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInOutCirc` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.85, 0.00, 0.15, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInBack` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.36, 0.00, 0.66,-0.56`\n| `easingsNetOutBack` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1.00`\n| `easingsNetInOutBack` | [easings.net](https://easings.net) | `0.68,-0.60, 0.32, 1.6 `\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### `Animateable` constructor options\n:::\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Animateable constructor options\" classes=\"wide-4\"\n| Option | Type | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `duration` | Number | `0` | Indicates the duration in milliseconds of the animation. |\n| `timing` | Array | `[0,0,1,1]` | <p>Customizes the global timing function used by `Animateable` to compute values between frames.

Just remember that `setKeyframes` will always `stop` the animation, and if you call `seek` while an animation is progressing, the animation will continue progressing after it seeks to the time progress you specified.\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nIf you call a method when it's not supposed to be called, it won't cause any errors, it will simply have no effect on the animation.\n:::\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nAll methods always return the `Animateable` instance (i.e. `this`), regardless of `status`.\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### How to handle frames\n:::\n\nFinally, the good stuff!\n\nThe first step to handling frames is to pass a callback function to the `play`, `reverse` or `seek` methods when you call them. `Animateable` will call that function at a rate of 60 frames per second, passing the current frame as the first argument.\n\nEach frame is an Object with a `data` property and a `progress` property. The value of each of those properties is also an Object, and they keys in both objects are all the properties from your `keyframes`.\n\nIn the `frame.data` object, the value of each property is the actual computed value for the property at that point in the animation.\n\n:::\n```js\n// frame.data\n{\n  data: {\n myProperty: 10,\n  },\n  progress: {...},\n}\n```\n:::\n\nIn the `frame.progress` object, the value of each property is an object with a `time` property and an `animation` property, which each contain a number between `0` and `1` representing the time progress and animation progress between the previous and next keyframes for that property.\n\n:::\n```js\n// frame.progress\n{\n  data: {...},\n  progress: {\n    myProperty: {\n      time: 0.25,\n      animation: 0.5,\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n:::\n\nFor a simple example, imagine you passed these keyframes:\n\n:::\n```js\n[\n  {\n    progress: 0,\n    data: { myProperty: 0 }\n  },\n  {\n    progress: 1,\n    data: { myProperty: 100 }\n  }\n]\n```\n:::\n\nAfter you call the `play` method, the first frame for your callback function would look like this:\n\n:::\n```js\n{\n  data: { myProperty: 0 }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nAssuming you're using the default linear timing function, this is the frame your callback function would receive exactly halfway through the animation:\n\n:::\n```js\n{\n  data: { myProperty: 50 },\n  progress: {\n    myProperty: {\n      time: 0.5,\n      animation: 0.5,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nAnd this is the last frame your callback would receive:\n\n:::\n```js\n{\n  data: { myProperty: 100 },\n  progress: {\n    myProperty: {\n      time: 1,\n      animation: 1,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nThings get slightly more complex when your keyframes don't just start at `progress: 0` and end at `progress: 1`. Consider the following keyframes:\n\n:::\n```js\n[\n  {\n    progress: 0,\n    data: { myProperty: 0 }\n  },\n  {\n    progress: .5,\n    data: { myProperty: 25 }\n  },\n  {\n    progress: 1,\n    data: { myProperty: 100 }\n  }\n]\n```\n:::\n\nAssuming you're using the default linear timing function, this is the frame your callback function would receive exactly one quarter of the way through the animation, when the Animateable instance's `progress.time` is `0.25`:\n\n:::\n```js\n{\n  data: { myProperty: 12.5 },\n  progress: {\n    myProperty: {\n      time: 0.5, // Halfway between the previous and next keyframes\n      animation: 0.5, // With linear timing, animation progress equals time progress\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nThis is the frame your callback function would receive exactly halfway through the animation, when the Animateable instance's `progress.time` is `0.5`:\n\n:::\n```js\n{\n  data: { myProperty: 25 },\n  progress: {\n    myProperty: {\n      time: 0, // Time progress resets to 0 when you get to next keyframe\n      animation: 0,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere's the frame at three quarters progress, when the Animateable instance's `progress.time` is `0.75`:\n\n:::\n```js\n{\n  data: { myProperty: 62.5 },\n  progress: {\n    myProperty: {\n      time: 0.5,\n      animation: 0.5,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nAnd this is the last frame your callback would receive, when the Animateable instance's `progress.time` is `1`:\n\n:::\n```js\n{\n  data: { myProperty: 100 },\n  progress: {\n    myProperty: {\n      time: 1,\n      animation: 1,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo what should you do with that frame inside your callback function? The intention behind `Animateable` is that you'll use `frame.data` to assign styles to an element.\n\nTake this callback function for example:\n\n:::\n```js\nconst el = document.querySelector('#el')\n\nfunction handleFrame (frame) {\n  el.style.transform = `translateX(${frame.data.myProperty}%)`\n}\n```\n:::\n\nThat callback function translates an element to the right by a percentage value determined by your frame data. As the animation progresses, the element will move from `0%` to `100%`.\n\nIn the same callback function, you could set additional styles with the exact same frame data, if you wanted:\n\n:::\n```js\nconst el = document.querySelector('#el')\n\nfunction handleFrame (frame) {\n  el.style.transform = `translateX(${frame.data.myProperty}%)`\n  el.style.backgroundColor = `rgb(255, 255, ${frame.data.myProperty})`\n}\n```\n:::\n\nThat callback function would move the element to the right and steadily change its background color at the same time.\n\n`frame.progress` is less useful, but is exactly what you will need if you ever want to visualize the progress of individual keyframe-to-keyframe transitions (`time` and `animation` progress are the `x` and `y` coordinates of the current point on an easing curve).\n\nNote that if you have multiple unique properties in your `keyframes`, every property will be included in every frame's data.\n\nTake these keyframes for example:\n\n:::\n```js\n[\n  // translateX\n  {\n    progress: 0,\n    data: { translateX: 0 }\n  },\n  {\n    progress: 1,\n    data: { translateX: 100 }\n  },\n\n  // blueChannel (of rgb color)\n  {\n    progress: 0.5,\n    data: { blueChannel: 0 }\n  },\n  {\n    progress: 1,\n    data: { blueChannel: 255 }\n  },\n]\n```\n:::\n\nGiven those keyframes, and assuming you're still using the default linear timing function, here's the frame you would receive when the `Animateable` instance's `progress.time` is `0.25`:\n\n:::\n```js\n{\n  data: {\n    translateX: 25,\n    blueChannel: 0,\n  },\n  progress: {\n    translateX: { time: 0.25, animation: 0.25 },\n    blueChannel: { time: 0.5, animation: 0.5 }, // Halfway from the animation start to the start of its first keyframe\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nHere's what you would get when the `Animateable` instance's `progress.time` is `0.5`:\n\n:::\n```js\n{\n  data: {\n    translateX: 50,\n    blueChannel: 0,\n  },\n  progress: {\n    translateX: { time: 0.5, animation: 0.5 },\n    blueChannel: { time: 0, animation: 0 }, // Starting its first keyframe transition\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nAnd here's what you would get when the `Animateable` instance's `progress.time` is `0.75`:\n\n:::\n```js\n{\n  data: {\n    translateX: 75,\n    blueChannel: 127.5,\n  },\n  progress: {\n    translateX: { time: 0.75, animation: 0.75 },\n    blueChannel: { time: 0.5, animation: 0.5 }, // Halfway through its keyframe transition\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nThe important thing to remember is that all properties are included in every frame, even if their value doesn't change, and regardless of how your keyframes are ordered and organized.\n\nAnd that covers all of the basic concepts! But what we haven't covered yet is how to handle strings and arrays that you pass to your keyframes.\n\nAs explained in the [How data types are animated](#How-data-types-are-animated) section, strings are always assumed to be colors. So, you can set them to any color property on an element:\n\n:::\n```js\nconst el1 = document.querySelector('#el1'),\n      el2 = document.querySelector('#el2'),\n      keyframes = [\n        // white to red\n        {\n          progress: 0,\n          data: { whiteToIndigo: \"#fff\" },\n        },\n        {\n          progress: 1,\n          data: { whiteToIndigo: 'hsl(246.8, 60.8%, 60%)' }\n        },\n\n        // red to white\n        {\n          progress: 0,\n          data: { indigoToWhite: 'hsl(246.8, 60.8%, 60%)' },\n        },\n        {\n          progress: 1,\n          data: { indigoToWhite: '#fff' }\n        },\n      ]\n\nfunction handleFrame ({ data: { whiteToIndigo, redToWhite } }) { // Use destructuring! It's awesome.\n  el1.style.color = redToWhite\n  el1.style.backgroundColor = whiteToIndigo\n\n  el2.style.color = whiteToRed\n  el2.style.backgroundColor = redToWhite\n}\n```\n:::\n\nNote that you don't have to use the same color format between keyframes—you can freely mix and match hex, hsl, rgb, and lab colors\n\n\nArrays are primarily intended to be used to achieve the \"typewriter\" affect, although there are probably other cool things you can do with them.\n\nHere's an example of how the typewriter effect would work:\n\n:::\n```js\nconst el1 = document.querySelector('#el1'),\n      keyframes = [\n        // write 'Baleada'\n        {\n          progress: 0,\n          data: { word: [] },\n        },\n        {\n          progress: 1,\n          data: { word: 'baleada'.split('') } // Much easier to split the string instead of write the array manually\n        },\n      ]\n\nfunction handleFrame ({ data: { word } }) {\n  el1.style.textContent = word.join('')\n}\n```\n:::\n\nGiven those keyframes and that frame handler, your `Animateable` instance would progressively change the text content of your element, making it look like the word \"Baleada\" is being typed across the screen.\n\n\n\n:::\n## API design compliance\n:::\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"A table showing Animateable's API design compliance\"  classes=\"wide-1 wide-3\"\n| Spec | Compliance status | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Access functionality by constructing an instance | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Constructor accepts two parameters: a piece of state,and an `options` object. | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Takes the form of a JavaScript Object | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| State and methods are accessible through properties of the object | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Methods always return the instance | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Stores the constructor's state in a public getter named after the state's type | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `keyframes`  |\n| Has a public method you can use to set a new value for that public getter | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `setKeyframes` |\n| Has a setter for that getter so you can assign a new value directly | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Any other public getters that should be set by you in some cases also have setters and `set<Property>` methods | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `playbackRate`, `setPlaybackRate` |\n| Has at least one additional getter property that you can't (and shouldn't) set directly | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `status`, `request`, `iterations`, `time`, `progress` |\n| Has one or more public methods that expose core functionality | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `play`, `reverse`, `pause`, `seek`, `restart`, `stop` |\n| Either has no side effects or has side effects that can be cleaned up with a `stop` method | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Uses the sentence template to decide what state type should be accepted by a constructor | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | \"Keyframes can be animated.\" |\n| Constructor does not accept options that only customize the behavior of public methods, it allows those options to be passed to the method itself as a parameter. | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | |\n| Named after its core action, proper-cased and suffixed with `able` | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `animate` (private method) |\n:::\n",

Calls your `onComplete` function, passing the completed string as the first argument and itself (i.e. `this`) as the second argument.\n2. Calls your `onLocate` function, passing the new location as the first argument and itself (i.e. `this`) as the second argument.\n\nThe default `onComplete` and `onLocate` functions, shown below, set `string` to the completed string and `location` to the new location each time you call `complete`:\n\n:::\n\n```js\n/*\n * Default onComplete function for Completeable\n */\n(completedString, instance) => instance.setString(completedString)\n\n/*\n * Default onLocate function for Completeable\n */\n(newLocation, instance) => instance.setLocation(newLocation)\n```\n\n:::\n\n\nWhen the Completeable instance's `complete` method is called, passing a `completion` as the first parameter, Completeable will create a completed version of the `string` and will compute a new value for `location`.\n\nThe completed string is a new version of the instance's `string`, with its `segment` replaced by the `completion`. After completing the `string`, the `complete` method calls your `onComplete` function, passing the completed string as the first argument.\n\nThe new value for `location` is computed based on the `locatesAfterCompletion` option, passed using the `complete` function's `options` argument:\n\n:::\n\n```js\ncompletable.complete('my completion', { locatesAfterCompletion: true })\n```\n\n:::\n\n`locatesAfterCompletion` defaults to `true`.\n\nWhen `locatesAfterCompletion` is `true`, the new location will be the the index-based location just after the end of the `completion`. This is equal to the length of any text before the `segment` plus the length of the `completion`. But, when `locatesAfterCompletion` is `false`, the new location will be equal to the old location.\n\nAfter computing the new location, the `complete` method calls your `onLocate` function, passing the new location as the first argument.\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nNote that `complete` does not set `string` or `location` to the new values, but you can do so using `setString` and `setLocation`.\n::: -->\n",

Instead, it depends on [`Animateable`](/docs/logic/classes/Animateable), which uses [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) (among other dependencies) internally.\n\nBecause of this, your `Delayable` delays will pause when the tab is inactive (i.e. when users switch to a different tab), and will resume when the tab is active again (i.e. when users return to your tab).\n\nThis is different than the behavior you would get from `setTimeout` and `setInterval`—browsers typically (and inconsistently) throttle those timers when the tab is inactive, rather than pausing and resuming them via `requestAnimationFrame`.\n\nSo, just be aware: even though `Delayable`'s API is designed to replace the `setTimeout` and `setInterval` APIs, it does work differently under the hood.\n\n\n:::\n## Construct a `Delayable` instance\n:::\n\nTo construct a `Delayable` instance (Object), use the `Delayable` constructor, which takes two parameters:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Delayable constructor parameters\" classes=\"wide-4\"\n| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `callback` | Function | yes | <p>Passes the callback function that will be made delayable.</p><p>Your callback function can accept a `timestamp` parameter—a [DOMHighResTimeStamp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) indicating the time since time origin.</p> |\n| `options` | Object | no | Passes options for the `Delayable` instance.

Just remember that `setCallback` will always `stop` the delay, and if you call `seek` while a delay is progressing, the animation will continue delaying after it seeks to the time progress you specified.\n- You can only `resume` after calling `pause` or `seek`\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nIf you call a method when it's not supposed to be called, it won't cause any errors, it will simply have no effect on the delay.\n:::\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nAll methods always return the `Delayable` instance (i.e. `this`), regardless of `status`.\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## API design compliance\n:::\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"A table showing Delayable's API design compliance\"  classes=\"wide-1 wide-3\"\n| Spec | Compliance status | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Access functionality by constructing an instance | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Constructor accepts two parameters: a piece of state,and an `options` object. | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Takes the form of a JavaScript Object | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| State and methods are accessible through properties of the object | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Methods always return the instance | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Stores the constructor's state in a public getter named after the state's type | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `callback`  |\n| Has a public method you can use to set a new value for that public getter | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `setCallback` |\n| Has a setter for that getter so you can assign a new value directly | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Any other public getters that should be set by you in some cases also have setters and `set<Property>` methods | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | none |\n| Has at least one additional getter property that you can't (and shouldn't) set directly | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `status`, `executions`, `time`, `progress` |\n| Has one or more public methods that expose core functionality | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `delay`, `pause`, `seek`, `resume`, `stop` |\n| Either has no side effects or has side effects that can be cleaned up with a `stop` method | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Uses the sentence template to decide what state type should be accepted by a constructor | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | \"A callback can be delayed.\" |\n| Constructor does not accept options that only customize the behavior of public methods, it allows those options to be passed to the method itself as a parameter. | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | |\n| Named after its core action, proper-cased and suffixed with `able` | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | |\n:::\n",

The Editable instance will remove all items for which the `options.item` function returns `true`.\n\nFor example, if you have an array of objects that have a unique ID in the `id` key, and you want the Editable instance to find and delete the item whose ID is `'abc'`, you can call `erase` like so:\n\n:::\n```js\neditable.erase({\n  item: currentItem => currentItem.id === 'abc'\n})\n```\n:::\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nIf `options.item(currentItem)` returns `false` for every item in `state`, the Editable instance will not remove any items.\n\nIf `options.item(currentItem)` returns `true` for more than one item in `state`, all of the matching items will be removed.\n::: -->\n",

For full information on how to use the `Recognizeable` class, [visit the `Recognizeable` docs](/docs/logic/classes/Recognizeable) (especially the [section on constructor options](/docs/logic/classes/Recognizeable#recognizeable-constructor-options) and the [section on accessing state and methods](/docs/logic/classes/Recognizeable#access-state-and-methods)), but keep reading here to learn the overall workflow.\n\nTo get started, construct a new instance of `Listenable`, using `'recognizeable'` as the `eventType`, and passing the `Recognizeable` options object to the `recognizeable` option:\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Listenable('recognizeable', {\n  recognizeable: {...} // See the Recognizeable docs for all available options\n})\n```\n:::\n\nUsing that, `Listenable` will construct a new instance of `Recognizeable`, passing an empty array as the first argument (where `Recognizeable` stores the event sequence) and your `recognizeable` object as the second argument (the `options` argument).\n\n`Listenable` will store your constructed `Recognizeable` instance in its `recognizeable` property:\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Listenable('recognizeable', { recognizeable: {...} })\n\ninstance.recognizeable instanceof Recognizeable // -> true\n```\n:::\n\nAt this time, `Listenable` will also extract a list of all the properties in `options.recognizeable.handlers` and store it internally.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Listenable('recognizeable', {\n  recognizeable: {\n    handlers: {...}\n  }\n})\n\n// The properties of options.recognizeable.handlers\n// are the names of events that Listenable should be \n// listening for. Listenable stores them internally\n// for use later on (when you call the listen method).\n```\n:::\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nNot sure what to pass to `options.recognizeable.handlers`?\n\nDon't sweat it—check out the [Baleada Listenable Gestures](/docs/listenable-gestures) package, which gives you access to pre-built `handlers` objects for commonly needed gestures:\n- `clicks` (i.e. double-clicks, triple-clicks, etc.)\n- `drag`\n- `dragdrop`\n- `pan`\n- `pinch`\n- `press`\n- `rotate`\n- `swipe`\n- `taps`\n:::\n\nWhen you call the `listen` method, passing your `callback` function, `Listenable` will add an event listener for each of the properties/events in `options.recognizeable.handlers`.\n\nAs events occur, `Listenable` will pass them through to your `Recognizeable` instance's `recognize` method, which in turn will pass the events to your event handlers.\n\nWhen your `Recognizeable` instance recognizes a gesture, Listenable will execute your callback. Your callback will receive an object with the following properties:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"\"\n| Property | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `event` | Event | An [Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) object for the latest event in the event sequence you are recognizing |\n| `recognizeable` | Object | The `Listenable` instance's `recognizeable` instance (which you can also access via your `Listenable` instance's `recognizeable` property) |\n:::\n\n\n<!-- TODO: swipe right example -->\n\n\n:::\n## API design compliance\n:::\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"A table showing Listenable's API design compliance\"  classes=\"wide-1 wide-3\"\n| Spec | Compliance status | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Access functionality by constructing an instance | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Constructor accepts two parameters: a piece of state,and an `options` object. | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Takes the form of a JavaScript Object | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| State and methods are accessible through properties of the object | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Methods always return the instance | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Stores the constructor's state in a public getter named after the state's type | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `eventType`  |\n| Has a public method you can use to set a new value for that public getter | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `setEventType` |\n| Has a setter for that getter so you can assign a new value directly | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Any other public getters that should be set by you in some cases also have setters and `set<Property>` methods | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | none |\n| Has at least one additional getter property that you can't (and shouldn't) set directly | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `status`, `activeListeners`, `recognizeable` |\n| Has one or more public methods that expose core functionality | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `listen`, `stop` |\n| Either has no side effects or has side effects that can be cleaned up with a `stop` method | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `stop` |\n| Uses the sentence template to decide what state type should be accepted by a constructor | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | \"A type of event can be listened for.\" |\n| Constructor does not accept options that only customize the behavior of public methods, it allows those options to be passed to the method itself as a parameter. | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | |\n| Named after its core action, proper-cased and suffixed with `able` | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | |\n:::\n",

Here's a breakdown of the `options` object:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Options for the next and previous methods\" classes=\"wide-4\"\n| Option | Type | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `distance` | Number | `1` | The number of items that will be traversed when the navigateable instance is stepping forward (`next`) or backward (`previous`) through the array. |\n| `loops` | Boolean | `true` | <p>Indicates whether or not `Navigateable` should loop around to the beginning or end of the array when navigating past those points.</p><p>See the table below for more info on exactly how looping works.</p> |\n:::\n\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"How the loops option affects navigation\"\n| When `loops` is... | And the computed location is... | The new location is... |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `false` | `array.length` or greater | `array.length - 1` |\n| `false` | `-1` or less | `0` |\n| `true` | greater than `array.length - 1` | See explanation below |\n| `true` | less than `0` | See explanation below |\n:::\n\nWhen `loops` is `true` and the computed location is greater than `array.length - 1` (the largest index-based location), your` Navigateable` instance calculates how much greater the computed location is, then takes that number of steps forward through the array, looping back to the beginning any time it passes `array.length - 1`.\n\nSee the code below for specific examples:\n\n:::\n```js\n// The loops option is true by default\nconst instance = new Navigateable(['Baleada', 'Logic', 'Navigateable'])\n\ninstance.navigate(2) // The array is now located at its last item\ninstance.next() // The array navigated past the end of the array, so it will return to the beginning\ninstance.location // -> 0\n\ninstance.next({ distance: 5 }) // The array's location is 0, and its largest index is 2.\n/*\n * The array starts at 0, where it left off.\n * Your instance navigates 2 steps forward and reaches the last location (3 steps remain).\n * It steps forward once more, looping around to 0 (2 steps remain).\n * It then makes its final 2 steps, landing on 2 (0 steps remain).\n */\ninstance.location // -> 2\n\n```\n:::\n\nWhen `loops` is `true` and the computed location is less than `0`, your `Navigateable` instance does the same thing, but in reverse: it calculates how much less the computed location is, then takes that number of steps backward through the array, looping around to the end any time it passes `0`.\n\nSee the code below for specific examples:\n\n:::\n```js\n// The loops option is true by default\nconst instance = new Navigateable(['Baleada', 'Logic', 'Navigateable'])\n\ninstance.navigate(0) // The array is now located at its first item\ninstance.previous() // The array navigated past the beginning of the array, so it will loops to the end\ninstance.location // -> 2\n\ninstance.previous({ distance: 5 }) // The array's location is 2, and its lowest index is 0.\n/*\n * The array starts at 2, where it left off.\n * Your instance navigates 2 steps backward and reaches 0 (3 steps remain).\n * It steps backward once more, looping around to 2 (2 steps remain).\n * It then makes its final two steps, landing on 0 (0 steps remain).\n */\ninstance.location // -> 0\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## API design compliance\n:::\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"A table showing Navigateable's API design compliance\"  classes=\"wide-1 wide-3\"\n| Spec | Compliance status | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Access functionality by constructing an instance | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Constructor accepts two parameters: a piece of state,and an `options` object. | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Takes the form of a JavaScript Object | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| State and methods are accessible through properties of the object | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Methods always return the instance | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Stores the constructor's state in a public getter named after the state's type | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `array`  |\n| Has a public method you can use to set a new value for that public getter | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `setArray` |\n| Has a setter for that getter so you can assign a new value directly | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |\n| Any other public getters that should be set by you in some cases also have setters and `set<Property>` methods | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `location`, `setLocation` |\n| Has at least one additional getter property that you can't (and shouldn't) set directly | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `status`, `item` |\n| Has one or more public methods that expose core functionality | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `navigate`, `next`, `previous`, `random` |\n| Either has no side effects or has side effects that can be cleaned up with a `stop` method | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | no side effects |\n| Uses the sentence template to decide what state type should be accepted by a constructor | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | \"An array can be navigated.\" |\n| Constructor does not accept options that only customize the behavior of public methods, it allows those options to be passed to the method itself as a parameter. | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `next(options)`, `previous(options)` |\n| Named after its core action, proper-cased and suffixed with `able` | <ApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | |\n:::\n",

After the instance is constructed, `status` will be `ready`.\n1. Any time the `recognize` method is called, `status` switches to `recognizing` before the new event is passed to your event handlers.\n2. `status` remains `recognizing` until one of your handlers calls the `recognized` or `denied` functions in the [Handler API](#how-to-format-handlers), at which point `status` becomes `recognized` or `denied` (depending on which function your handler called).\n\nAlso, be aware that the `denied` function doesn't _just_ set `status` to `denied`—it also resets `metadata` to an empty object and resets `sequence` to an empty array.\n\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nAll methods always return the `Recognizeable` instance (i.e. `this`), regardless of `status`.\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Handler workflow\n:::\n\nNow that all of `Recognizeable`'s state and methods have been defined and you've finished drowning in the Handler API breakdown, it's time to learn more about `Recognizeable`'s handler workflow.\n\nHere's what the workflow looks like:\n1. A DOM event gets passed to the `recognize` method.\n2. Internally, the `recognize` method discerns the type of that DOM event.\n3. The `recognize` method looks through the `handlers` object (passed to the constructor option) and finds the property that matches the discerned event type.\n4. `recognize` calls the handler function stored at that property, passing the Handler API (which includes the original DOM event).\n5. Your handler function receives the DOM event and should extract some information from it. For example: at what `x` and `y` coordinates did the event take place? At what time did the event take place?\n6. Your handler function can use the Handler API's `setMetadata`, `pushMetadata` and `insertMetadata` functions to store metadata about the event for future use. You can also use `getMetadata` to retrieve the entire metadata object in case you need to reference some information you've already stored.\n7. Based on all of the information you've gathered, your handler should make a decision: \n    - Has the custom gesture been recognized? If so, call the `recognized` function. `Recognizeable` will update the `sequence` with the most recent event and leave `metadata` in its current state.\n    - Still not sure, and need to wait for more events? Do nothing—just like with `recognized`, `Recognizeable` will update the `sequence` with the most recent event and leave `metadata` in its current state.\n    - Final option: did something happen that makes your custom gesture impossible (e.g. a `mouseup` event when you're trying to recognize a drag/pan gesture)? If so, call the `denied` function to deny the event, trigger a full reset, and start the workflow from the beginning.\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nStill not sure how to use this workflow to recognize your custom gestures?

    "body": ":::\n## UI features are composed from logic.\n:::\n\nThe big idea behind Baleada Logic, [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), the [Vue composition API](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com/), and functional programming in general is that the easiest way to create large, complex UI features is to **compose** them from smaller pieces of UI logic. Learning how to identify the discrete pieces of UI logic hidden inside of bigger UI features is the key to success with Baleada Logic.\n\n:::\n> The easiest way to create large, complex UI features is to **compose** them from smaller pieces of UI logic.\n:::\n\nFor example, imagine you want to add an autocomplete feature to your UI, so that the end user can start typing, be prompted with matching options, and pick one to automatically complete the text they were typing.\n\nAt first glance, you might think of \"autocomplete\" as the piece of UI logic you need to create, but autocomplete can actually be broken down into several smaller pieces of logic:\n:::\n1. As the user is typing, you need to extract the segment of their text that can be completed. In a simple text input, this is the entire value, but in a large text area, it's more likely to be just the current word the user is typing.\n2. You need to search a list of autocomplete options, using your segment of text as a search query. The search should fuzzy match, in case the user makes a typo.\n3. You need to display the search results in a dropdown menu on the screen. For the best user experience, the dropdown menu should reposition itself automatically, making sure that options are still visible if the user scrolls and changes the amount of available screen space.\n4. The dropdown menu should be keyboard accessible. Up and down arros keys should move options into focus. If the user is at the bottom of the list and presses the down arrow again, you should move focus back to the top of the list.\n5. When the user selects an option, you need to replace the original segment of text with the completed version.\n:::\n\nUsing tools from Baleada Logic, you would approach this list of logic like so:\n:::\n1. [`Completable`](/docs/logic/classes/completable) extracts the segment of text\n2. [`Searchable`](/docs/logic/classes/searchable) searches a list of options for the segment (fuzzy matching is optional)\n3. [`Listenable`](/docs/logic/classes/listenable) detects when the dropdown menu starts leaving the viewport, and gives you some information so that you can simply apply a CSS `transform: translate` to move the menu into a visible spot.\n4. [`Navigable`](/docs/logic/classes/navigable) tracks which option should be in focus, and can loop around to the beginning or end of the list as needed.\n5. `Completable` completes the segment of text with a completed value chosen by the user.\n:::\n\nIt might seem strange to break this feature down and implement it with so many separate tools, but this approach is what allows logic to become abstract enough to be reusable. An autocomplete feature is only useful in situations where you need to autocomplete, but a fuzzy-matching search feature is useful in all kinds of different places.\n\nAnyway, that's the basic concept, but let's explore some more concrete examples of how individual Baleada Logic tools can be reused across various UI features.\n\n\n:::\n## A simple example of reusability\n:::\n\nConsider these components, which appear in all kinds of user interfaces:\n- Carousel\n- Custom dropdown menu\n- Date picker\n- Solitaire\n\n(Ok fine, solitaire isn't common—but you'll see that a solitaire component's behavior has a lot more in common with carousels, dropdowns, and date pickers than you might think!)\n\nVisually, these components are so different that it feels clean and correct to build them all in isolation, or install isolated packages that contain them. But if you look more closely, these components share a decent number of different behaviors:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Behaviors that carousels, dropdowns, date pickers, and solitaire have in common\" classes=\"wide-1\"\n| Behavior | Carousel | Dropdown | Date picker | Solitaire |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Click a button or use an arrow key to move backward or forward | yes | yes | yes | yes |\n| Loop back to the beginning after navigating forwards past the last item | usually | yes | N/A  | yes |\n| Loop back to the end after navigating backwards past the first item | usually | yes | N/A | no |\n| Go to a specific item | yes | not usually | yes | no |\n| Move forward and back in custom increments | yes, if the carousel displays more than 1 image at a time | no | yes | yes (3-card or 1-card advance) |\n| Go to a random item | sometimes | no | sometimes | no |\n:::\n\nAcross each of these components, the code that implements this collection of array-navigating behaviors is more or less the same. But when you're using Baleada Logic, you don't have to write or install the same array-navigating code separately for each one of those components.\n\nInstead, you just build your array of images, dropdown options, years/months/days, or playing cards, and you pass the array to the constructor of `Navigable`—one of Baleada Logic's classes—to create an instance of the `Navigable` class.\n\nThe `Navigable` class has all the methods you need to navigate forward, backward, to a specific item, or even to a random item. Its methods for moving forward and backward can handle custom increments (e.g. moving forward 3 cards in solitaire) and can loop around to the beginning or end of the array (both features are optional based on parameters you pass to the method when it's called).\n\nArray navigation is on the simpler end of the UI logic spectrum, but it's a great example of logic that can easily get tangled up and repeated inside seemingly unrelated components instead of being extracted into something more reusable and feature-complete.\n\n:::\n> Array navigation is a great example of logic that can easily get tangled up and repeated inside seemingly unrelated components instead of being extracted into something more reusable and feature-complete.\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## A more complex example of reusability\n:::\n\nFor something more complex, imagine you're building the following components:\n- Custom image component for a social networking app\n- A sidebar navigation menu for a documentation site\n- A message in an inbox\n- A wrapper component (or maybe just a plain function) that detects user mouse movements, computes analytics, and sends the analytics to a server\n\nThese components are wildly different, but let's double-check some of the behaviors these components should have, to see if we can find similarities:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Behaviors that image components and navigation menus need\" classes=\"wide-1\"\n| Behavior | Custom image | Sidebar nav | Inbox message | Analytics wrapper |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Don't load the resource until the element is visible | yes | no | it's possible | no |\n| Do something when the user hits a specific keystroke | no | yes (toggle dark mode) | yes (reply all, compose new message, etc.) | no |\n| Do something when the user moves the mouse | no | no | no | yes (store mouse position for analytics) |\n| Do something when the user double taps | yes (\"like\" the image) | no | probably not | no |\n| Do something when the user swipes right | yes (initiate mating sequence) | yes (on mobile, open the menu) | yes (archive the message) | no |\n| Do something when the user is idle | no | no | yes (save draft reply) | yes (compute and send analytics) |\n:::\n\nHmm...okay, it looks like some of these behaviors overlap, but not that closely.\n\nNotice, however, that every single one of these behaviors has a similar structure: when something specific happens, take an action. To be more precise: when an event or combination of events is fired, execute a callback function.\n\nIf you were writing all of this behavior yourself across each of these components, you would most likely use:\n:::\n- An [Intersection Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/intersectionObserver)\n- A third-party [gesture recognition library](https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch/) that supports \"swipe right\" and \"double tap\"\n- [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)\n- [`requestIdleCallback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback) (to keep your analytics work off the main thread so that it doesn't slow down other processes)\n:::\n\nYou would also need to make sure that, when the components reach the end of their lifecycle:\n:::\n- The Intersection Observer disconnects from the images\n- The gesture recognizer is properly destroyed (hopefully the third party library has that option)\n- You execute [`removeEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener) for each corresponding `addEventListener`\n- You execute [`cancelIdleCallback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/cancelIdleCallback) for each corresponding `requestIdleCallback`\n:::\n\nAll that work and all of those APIs...just to make your app do something after something else happens!\n\nWith Baleada Logic, you would instead follow a straightforward process:\n1. Identify the name of the \"something\" that you're waiting for. For the components above, the \"somethings\" would be `'keydown'` `'intersect'`, `'tap'`, `'swipe'`, and `'idle'`.\n1. Pass the name of each \"something\" to a `Listenable` constructor to create instances of the `Listenable` class.\n1. Call your `Listenable` instances' `listen` methods, passing a callback function to each one that will triggers the appropriate action when its \"something\" happens. (You can also pass options to `listen`, for example, to make sure that you are only listening for an event on a specific element instead of the whole page.)\n1. Wait for your events to happen, and rest easy knowing that your callbacks will all run at the appropriate time!\n1. At the end of the components' lifecycles, call the `stop` method on your instances to stop all listening and observing (therefore avoiding memory leaks).\n\nThe idea behind `Listenable` is, that, at the end of the day, you shouldn't have to know or care whether the right tool to listen for any given \"something\" is an Observer, a magical gesture recognition library, the somewhat obscure `requestIdleCallback`, or good old `addEventListener`, and you _definitely_ shouldn't have to know or care about how to clean up side effects and avoid memory leaks with each tool.\n\nThese tools, as nifty as they are, are implementation details in their truest form. Their inconsistent APIs are the _last_ thing you should be worrying about when all you really need is to add that \"do something when something else happens\" behavior to your project.\n\n\n:::\n## A sweeping conclusion\n:::\n\nThe purpose of Baleada Logic is to abstract repetitive but relatively complex UI logic into something more reusable, so that you can focus on the aesthetics and business logic of your project instead of fiddling with web APIs, doing algebra, performing basic state management, getting into the weeds with `this`, remembering where and how to use all the methods of native prototypes, etc.\n\n:::\n> The purpose of Baleada Logic is to abstract repetitive but relatively complex UI logic into something more reusable, so that you can focus on the aesthetics and business logic of your project.\n:::\n\nBaleada's abstractions take the form of **JavaScript classes** and **factory functions**. These classes and factories do several important things:\n:::\n- They expose a consistent, unified, intuitive API, regardless of what behaviors and feature you're trying to add to your poject\n- They avoid side effects in the DOM whenever possible, and when not possible, they offer a consistent API for cleaning up afterward\n- The _only_ assumption they make about your DOM is that you have one. And sometimes, they don't even assume that!\n- They offer an intentionally limited set of features and functionality. In your project, any component worth its salt won't be powered by a single Baleada Logic class or factory—instead, your components will compose features using more than one class or factory, sometimes even feeding state from one class into the methods of another.\n:::\n<!-- TODO: more stuff for that list?

However, the number one priority during Baleada's development was to add useful state and methods to websites and apps that are built on reactivity & component frameworks like Vue, React, or Svelte and bundled using Webpack, Rollup, or something similar.\n\nIn most cases, it's recommended that you use [Baleada Composition](/docs/composition) inside the framework & build chain of your choice instead of importing classes and factories directly from Baleada Logic.\n\nBaleada Composition has a dedicated composition function for each individual Baleada Logic class, plus composition functions that combine Baleada Logic classes to implement common UI patterns (think autocompletes, toasts, forms that auto-save, etc.).\n\nIf you're planning to use Baleada Composition, you won't need to know how to install and import classes and factories directly from Baleada Logic, but you'll still need to know how to use individual classes and factories. A great place to start is the [Identifying UI Logic](/docs/logic/identifying-ui-logic) guide, which will teach you core concepts and patterns that will help you use Baleada Logic's classes and factories successfully.\n\nAll of that said, the number _two_ priority during Baleada's development was to ensure it's still perfectly possible to use Baleada Logic in simpler projects, built with smaller JavaScript frameworks or no framework at all. If that sounds like your use case, keep reading! (And definitely check out the [Identifying UI Logic](/docs/logic/identifying-ui-logic) guide afterward.)\n\n\n:::\n## Install\n:::\n\n:::\n```bash\nnpm i @baleada/logic\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Import a class or factory\n:::\n\nAll classes are named exports in Baleada Logic's entry file, so you can import one like so:\n\n\n:::\n```js\nimport { Delayable } from '@baleada/logic'\n```\n:::\n\nFactories are named exports in a `factories.js` file at the root of Baleada Logic, so you can import one like so:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport { markupable } from '@baleada/logic/factories'\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Available classes and factories\n:::\n\nAll available classes and factories are listed in this site's navigation under **LOGIC** and linked to their specific documentation.\n\n\n:::\n## Language, compilation, browser support, and dependencies\n:::\n\nClasses and factories are written in modern JavaScript, and almost all of them have no dependencies of their own. They are compiled by [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to work in browsers that are used by more than 0.5% of global web visitors AND have had official support or updates in the past 24 months.\n\nTo allow for [tree-shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/), Baleada Logic's compiled code has no side effects and uses [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [`export`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) instead of [`require()`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_id) and [`module.exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports).\n\nDependencies, when they exist, were chosen with the following desirable characteristics in mind (in no particular order):\n- Framework agnostic\n- Few or no dependencies of their own\n- Small file size\n- Tree-shakeable\n- Small impact on apps' bundle size\n- Industry standard\n- Recommended/used by proficient, well-known, independent developers\n\nNot all dependencies meet every single one of those requirements. However, lots of care was taken to ensure that, if a dependency can be replaced by something better in the future, doing so will be quick and easy, and with any luck, won't result in breaking changes.\n",

For example:\n:::\n- Allowing the user to enter a search term and see a list of search results, filtered based on fuzzy matches\n- Autocompleting text, replacing all or part of the original text with a completed value\n- Detecting and reacting to common gestures (pan, swipe, double-tap, drag, drag-and-drop, etc.)\n:::\n\nTo complicate matters, those special behaviors will definitely need to be repeated and reused across projects, and even within the same project. To avoid spending all your time copy/pasting from project to project, fixing the same bug in 10 different places, and constantly reinventing the wheel, you'll need to find a way to **reuse your UI logic**.\n\nThere are several common solutions for making UI logic reusable, each with their pros and cons:\n\n:::\n\n| Solution | Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Big, custom components that handle everything—HTML structure, CSS styles, and UI logic | <ul><li>Great for quick-fix, plug-and-play use cases.</li><li>Great if you can build a limited selection of components that get shared and used frequently.</li><li>Doesn't require that you (the developer consuming this solution) understand how `this` works.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Usually accept massive amounts of props that you need to learn in order to customize any given detail.</li><li>Usually the wrong abstraction—it makes a specific application of UI logic reusable, but fails at making the underlying logic reusable.</li><li>Not really possible unless you're using a component framework like React, Vue, Svelte, etc.</li></ul> |\n| [Mixins](https://javascript.info/mixins) | <ul><li>Pretty intuitive approach: at the end of the day, it's just merging new properties into an object.</li><li>It's a general JavaScript technique that can be used outside of component frameworks</li></ul> | <ul><li>Leads to naming collisions between injected state and methods</li><li>Leads to broken components after the name of a mixed in property or method changes</li><li>Requires that you (the developer consuming this solution) have some understanding of how `this` works.</li></ul> |\n| [Renderless](https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/)/[Higher order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) | <ul><li>Effectively reuses logic without risk of naming collisions</li><li>Can be made highly customizable with only a few props</li></ul>  | <ul><li>Creates deeply nested component trees that are confusing to write and even harder to read.</li><li>Pretty difficult to pass state and methods down through nested renderless components to where it actually needs to be.</li><li>Not really possible unless you're using a component framework like React, Vue, Svelte, etc.</li><li>Usually requires that you (the developer consuming this solution) have some understanding of how `this` works.</li></ul> |\n\n:::\n\nAll of those solutions work to an extent, but their downsides are uncomfortable, and things only get worse as projects grow bigger. Also, real-world examples of these solutions are almost always implemented for just one reactivity & component framework, with no chance of working inside another framework without rewriting and maintaining a fully separate version.\n\nWith the introduction of [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and the [Vue composition API](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com), however, it has become possible to\n",

    "body": "Baleada SPA Links is a [Markdown-it](https://markdown-it.github.io/) plugin that replaces the default link markup with markup that tells your single-page application to handle the routing (i.e. navigate to the route without doing a full page refresh).\n\nFor example, if you're using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), you can write the following Markdown:\n\n:::\n```md\n[My other page](/my-other-page)\n```\n:::\n\nAnd Baleada SPA Links will render this:\n\n:::\n```html\n<p><NuxtLink to=\"/my-other-page\">My other page</NuxtLink></p>\n```\n:::\n\nThe plugin supports link components for the following tools:\n- [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com)\n- [Next](https://nextjs.org)\n- [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org)\n- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)\n- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)\n\n::: type=\"info\"\n[Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) was originally on the list of supported link components as well, but since [Sapper links are simply `<a>` elements](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Comparison_with_Next_js) instead of specific components, special rendering is not necessary.\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Installation\n:::\n\nYou can install Baleada SPA Links from NPM.\n\n:::\n```bash\nnpm i @baleada/spa-links\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Usage\n:::\n\nTo get started, import the plugin from the entry file of `@baleada/spa-links`, and create a Markdown-it instance.\n\n:::\n```js\nimport MarkdownItSpaLinks from '@baleada/spa-links/markdown-it'\nimport MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it'\n\nconst md = new MarkdownIt()\n```\n:::\n\nUse the `use` method of your Markdown-it instance to register the plugin. Pass the plugin as the first argument, and for the second argument, you can pass a configuration object. That object can have two properties:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Baleada SPA Links configuration schema\" classes=\"wide-5\"\n| Property | Value's type | Required? | Default | Value description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `spa` | String | yes | none | <p>Indicates which tool you are using to build your SPA, so that the plugin can identify the correct link component.</p><p>See the [Link components by tool](#Link-components-by-tool) reference table to see valid values for the `spa` option and which link components get rendered.</p> |\n| `base` | String | nope | none | <p>Passes the base URL of your site to help the plugin identify links within the site.</p><p>If `base` is not passed, the plugin will only use link components for URLs that start with `/`.</p> |\n:::\n\nFor example, here's how you would configure the plugin to work with Nuxt:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport MarkdownItSpaLinks from '@baleada/spa-links/markdown-it'\nimport MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it'\n\nconst md = new MarkdownIt()\n\nmd.use(MarkdownItSpaLinks, { spa: 'nuxt' })\n```\n:::\n\nAnd here's how you would pass the optional base URL:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport MarkdownItSpaLinks from '@baleada/spa-links/markdown-it'\nimport MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it'\n\nconst md = new MarkdownIt()\n\nmd.use(MarkdownItSpaLinks, { spa: 'nuxt', base: 'https://example.com' })\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### Link components by tool\n:::\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Reference table matching SPA tools with link components\"\n| When `spa` is... | Links are rendered with... |\n| --- | --- |\n| `'inertia'` | [`inertia-link`](https://inertiajs.com/links#top) |\n| `'next'` | [`Link` > `a`](https://nextjs.org/docs#with-link) |\n| `'nuxt'` | [`NuxtLink`](https://nuxtjs.org/api/components-nuxt-link#the-lt-nuxt-link-gt-component) |\n| `'react'` | [`Link`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link) |\n| `'vue'` | [`RouterLink`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#router-link) |\n:::\n",

Baleada provides UI logic for small, specific behaviors that are commonly needed, but can be complex to implement in a reusable way.\n\nFor example:\n- Allowing the user to enter a search term, query an array of strings or objects, and receive a list of search results based on fuzzy matches\n- Autocompleting text, replacing all or part of the original text with a completed value\n- Detecting and reacting to gestures (pan, swipe, double-tap, drag, drag-and-drop, etc.)\n\nUI logic like this is not only useful in its own right, but also when it gets composed into larger, more complicated UI features, which are way easier to build when you're working with the right tools!\n\nTo get started with Baleada's UI logic, check out the [Baleada Logic](/docs/logic) package.\n\n\n:::\n## Composition functions (a.k.a. hooks)\n:::\n\n\"Composition function\" is a term coined by the [Vue](https://vuejs.org) team to describe functions that **collocate code** related to the same logical concern. In [React](https://react.org), these functions are called \"hooks\", but the concept and motivations are virtually the same.\n\nBaleada's composition functions collocate **reactivity** code with **UI logic** code. More specifically, each Baleada composition function retrieves state and methods from one or more of the Baleada Logic tools, then makes all of the state reactive, using tools from the JavaScript framework of your choice.\n\nTo get started with Baleada's composition functions, check out the [Baleada Composition](/docs/composition) package.\n\n\n:::\n## Components\n:::\n\nIn their docs, the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) team include a fantastic definition of components: \"A component is a reusable self-contained block of code that encapsulates HTML, CSS and JavaScript that belong together.\"\n\nThe only thing Svelte's definition is missing (other than an Oxford comma 🤓) is a clarification that not all components need to have HTML, CSS, _and_ JavaScript, all together, all of the time. Baleada's components in particular always include HTML, but they omit all CSS so that you can style the component yourself. Some Baleada Components contain JavaScript, but some just contain HTML.\n\nRegardless of what they actually contain, all of Baleada's components are easy to import into any JavaScript-driven site or app, and they add value in different ways.\n\nTo get started with Baleada's components, check out these packages:\n- [Baleada Icons](/docs/icons)\n- [Baleada Prose](/docs/prose)\n\n\n:::\n## Configuration utilities\n:::\n\nThe build process for JavaScript-driven sites and apps is notoriously complex. Configuration files for build tools like Webpack, Rollup, Tailwind CSS, etc. make things much easier, but, when you're feeling picky about your developer experience, it can still be pretty difficult to get your configuration _just_ right.\n\nBaleada's configuration utilities are functions that you can use to generate configurations and abstract away certain parts of the configuration process. They're opinionated enough to steer you toward a particular developer experience, but still offer customization options of their own.\n\nTo get started with Baleada's configuration utilities, check out these packages:\n- [Baleada Linear Numeric](/docs/linear-numeric)\n- [Baleada Source Transform](/docs/source-transform)\n- [Baleada SPA Links](/docs/spa-links)\n\n",
