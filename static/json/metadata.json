    "body": "Baleada Gesture is a tiny [factory function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImwrezYhw4w) that helps you define custom [gestures](#what-is-a-gesture).\n\nThe function returns an API—more specifically, a JavaScript object with useful properties and methods that will help you handle DOM events and recognize gestures.\n\n\n:::\n## A note, before you dive in\n:::\n\nBaleada Gesture was designed and written during the development of the [`Listenable`](/docs/logic/classes/listenable) class in Baleada Logic, and [Baleada Listenable Gestures](/docs/listenable-gestures) is built on top of Baleada Gesture to help you listen for the following gestures in your project:\n- clicks (for recognizing single clicks, double clicks, or any other number of clicks)\n- drag\n- dragdrop\n- pan\n- pinch\n- press\n- rotate\n- swipe\n- taps (for recognizing single taps, double taps, or any other number of taps)\n\nBefore you use Baleada Gesture to define your own custom gestures, it's recommended that you check out the `Listenable` docs and the Baleada Listenable Gestures docs, and see how those tools work together. If you're satisfied with that workflow, and agree with the way the gestures are defined and recognized, you may not need to use Baleada Gesture at all.\n\nBut, if you don't agree with the way Baleada Listenable Gestures defines certain gestures, or if you want to add a new custom gesture, Baleada Gesture lays a great foundation that you can build upon!\n\n\n:::\n## What is a \"gesture\"?\n:::\n\nIn the context of Baleada Gesture, a \"gesture\" is defined as a sequence of DOM events that can be recognized as something more abstract. For example, a \"swipe\" gesture is:\n- A single touch,\n- that starts at a given point,\n- travels a distance greater than 0px (or a minimum distance of your choice),\n- travels at a velocity of greater than 0px/ms (or a minimum velocity of your choice),\n- does not cancel,\n- and finally, ends.\n\nThis sequence involves the [`touchstart`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchstart_event), [`touchmove`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchmove_event), [`touchcancel`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchcancel_event), and [`touchend`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchend_event) events. If those events happen in a particular order, and if their combined event data meets the conditions listed above, then the entire sequence of events can be considered one \"swipe\".\n\n\n:::\n## Installation\n:::\n\n:::\n```bash\nnpm i @baleada/gesture\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Usage\n:::\n\n:::\n### Import the factory function\n:::\n\nTo get started, import the `gesture` factory function from Baleada Gesture's entry file:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### Create your factory function\n:::\n\nAfter you import `gesture`, define your own factory function for your custom gesture:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  ...\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### Build your objects\n:::\n\nAt the bottom of your factory function, use the `gesture` function to create a gesture API with useful properties and methods ([more on this later](#gesture-object-properties-and-methods)), and create the object you'll be returning from your function. You'll be passing an options object to the `gesture` function, but we'll handle that part later.\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  // We'll be putting other code here\n\n  const api = gesture({ ... }),\n        object = {\n          // Add properties, methods, getters, setters, etc.\n        }\n\n  return object\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### Define your event handlers\n:::\n\nWith your objects defined at the bottom, start defining functions at the top. These functions will handle incoming DOM events, extract any metadata you need, and determine whether or not the full sequence of events matches the definition of your custom recognizer.\n\nYou can name these functions anything, but the best practice is to name them after the type of event they will be handling:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  function touchstart () {\n    ...\n  }\n  function touchmove () {\n    ...\n  }\n  function touchcancel () {\n    ...\n  }\n  function touchend () {\n    ...\n  }\n\n  const api = gesture({ ... }),\n        object = { ... }\n  return object\n}\n```\n:::\n\nFrom inside your functions, you can freely access your gesture API:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  function touchstart () {\n     console.log(api.events) // This works, because in practice, the function won't run until after the gesture API has been defined\n  }\n\n  ...\n\n  const api = gesture({ ... }),\n        object = { ... }\n  return object\n}\n```\n:::\n\nBelow is a full breakdown of the properties and methods included with the gesture API.\n\n:::\n### Gesture API properties and methods\n:::\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Gesture API properties and methods\" canFilterByQuery\n\n| Property | Type | Description | Parameters | Return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `status` | Getter | See return value | N/A | The current status (String) of the instance. `status` is always `'ready'`, `'recognizing'`, or `'recognized'`. |\n| `handle(event)` | Function | <p>Interprets the type of its `event` parameter and calls the matching method on your subclass.</p> <p>`handle` also calls the `reset` method (details below) IF `status` is `'recognized'` AND the `gesture` constructor's `recognizesConsecutive` option is `false`.</p> <p>`handle` also adds its `event` parameter to the `events` array (details below) and will remove events from that array IF the `gesture` constructor's `maxSequenceLength` option is a number AND the events array's length is greater than that number.</p> | N/A | `status` |\n| `events` | Getter | See return value | N/A | The events (Array) that have been passed to the `handle` method |\n| `lastEvent` | Getter | See return value | N/A | The last event (Event) in the `events` array |\n| `recognized()` | Function | Sets `status` to `'recognized'` | none | none |\n| `reset()` | Function | Sets `events` to an empty array, `lastEvent` to `undefined`, `status` to `'ready'`, and calls the optional `onReset` function, if available ([see below](#gesture-factory-options) for more info on the optional `onReset` function). | none | none |\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### Pass your event handlers to the gesture factory\n:::\n\nWhen you're satisfied with the functions you've defined, return to the `gesture` function's optional parameter, which is an object. Add a `handlers` property to the object. The value of the `handlers` property should be an object. The keys of the object should be the names of the DOM events you'll be listening to, and the values should be the functions you wrote previously to handle the events.\n\nIf you named your functions after the DOM events they handle, you can easily destructure them into your `handlers` object:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  function touchstart () { ... }\n  function touchmove () { ... }\n  function touchcancel () { ... }\n  function touchend () { ... }\n\n  const api = gesture({\n          handlers: { touchstart, touchmove, touchcancel, touchend }\n        }),\n        object = { ... }\n  return object\n}\n```\n:::\n\nInternally, your gesture API uses the `handlers` option to make sure all events are routed to the correct handler, so that your gesture-identifying logic runs properly.\n\n\n:::\n### Connect your object to the gesture API\n:::\n\nEach time a DOM event comes through, your gesture API will call the appropriate function defined in your `handlers` object, passing two arguments:\n1. The DOM event that just happened\n2. The \"handler API\". For more info on the handler API, [check out the full guide](/docs/gesture/handler-api).\n\nFor all of this to work, however, you need to make sure that events are being passed to your gesture API's `handle` method when they come through. You can connect these two objects however you like, but usually, the easiest way is to define a simple `handle` method on the object you'll be returning:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport gesture from '@baleada/gesture'\n\nexport default function pan () {\n  ...\n  const api = gesture({ ... }),\n        object = {\n          handle: event => api.handle(event)\n        }\n  return object\n}\n```\n:::\n\nThe last thing you need to know is what other options the `gesture` function accepts so that you can customize the object you receive back. Here's a full breakdown:\n\n:::\n### Gesture factory options\n:::\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Gesture factory options\" canFilterByQuery\n| Option | Type | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `handlers` | Object | none | Passes key/value pairs, where each key is the name of a DOM event you want to listen to, and each value is the appropriate handler function you defined for that event. |\n| `recognizesConsecutive` | Boolean | `false` | <p>Indicates whether or not `gesture` should be able to recognize the same gesture multiple times in a row without calling its `reset` method.</p> <p>Keep it as `false` for gestures like \"swipe\" and \"drag-and-drop\", which have precise starting and ending points. Set it to `true` for gestures like \"pan\" or \"click-and-drag\", which can continue to occur after they are first recognized.</p> |\n| `maxSequenceLength` | Number | `false` | <p>Defines the maximum number of events that the `gesture` class will keep track of.</p> <p>If `maxSequenceLength` is a number greater than 0, `gesture` will remove the first event in the array each time the `maxSequenceLength` is exceeded. If `maxSequenceLength` is `false`, `gesture` will never remove events from the array.</p> |\n| `onReset` | Function | none | Passes a function that your gesture API will call each time its own `reset()` method is called. Your gesture API calls its own `reset()` method when its `status` is `'recognized'` and the `recognizesConsecutive` options is `false`. You can use the `onReset` option to hook into that function call and properly reset any variables you're using to store metadata about events. |\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Inspiration for your custom gestures\n:::\n\nFor inspiration and some examples of how Baleada Gesture is used in practice, check out the [Baleada Listenable Gesture source code](https://gitlab.com/baleada/listenable-gestures/tree/master/src/factories).\n\n\n:::\n## Language, compilation, browser support, and dependencies\n:::\n\nBaleada Gesture is written in modern JavaScript and compiled by [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to work in browsers that are used by more than 0.5% of global web visitors AND have had official support or updates in the past 24 months.\n\nTo allow for [tree-shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/), Baleada Gesture's compiled code has no side effects and uses [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [`export`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) instead of [`require()`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_id) and [`module.exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports).\n\nBaleada Gesture has no dependencies.\n",

    "body": "Honduras's favorite food is the **baleada**—a fresh flour tortilla, spread with refried beans, then decorated with scrambled eggs, mantequilla, queso seco, avocado, or meat, and finally folded in half.\n\nYou can't have a baleada without its core ingredients and presentation (tortilla spread with refried beans and folded in half), but once those requirements are met, you can be creative and combine ingredients that suit your tastebuds.\n\nAnyway, the Baleada you're here for is **a toolkit for building web apps** (and websites). Getting down to brass tacks, Baleada offers the following types of tools:\n- UI logic\n- Composition functions (a.k.a. hooks)\n- SVG icon components\n- More to come ([see roadmap](/docs/roadmap))\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nFeeling a little fuzzy on what these terms mean? Check out the guide on [types of tools](/docs/types-of-tools) for definitions.\n:::\n\nThink of these tools as the ingredients in a savory, delectable baleada. You're encouraged to take what you want and sprinkle it into the stack you're already using to build your apps and websites. You're free to take just a few things, but if you're so inclined, you can really pile on the extras!\n\n\n:::\n## Who is Baleada designed for?\n:::\n\nBaleada is designed for developers who:\n- **Do** want to add common UI features and behaviors to their app, but **don't** want to think about implementation details.\n- **Do** value consistency and predictability in JavaScript library APIs.\n- **Do** care about performance, best practices, internationalization, accessibility, and security, but **haven't** had time to fine-tune this stuff in the past, because they've always been too busy hacking together a custom autocomplete component or another 🤬 carousel for the who-knows-how-many-th time.\n- **Do** appreciate the role React hooks and Vue composition functions play in making web dev easier and more inclusive.\n- **Do** appreciate [the benefits of using SVG over icon fonts](http://www.fullstackradio.com/47).\n- **Do** appreciate documentation that makes them hungry.\n<!-- - **Do** want a design system to govern their styles, but **don't** want their apps and sites to look like everyone else's. -->\n\nAll of Baleada's tools are copyrighted from 2019-present and licensed under the MIT license.\n",

How they are **constructed**\n1. How **state and methods** are made available to you\n1. How classes & factories, their constructor options, their state, and their methods are **named**\n1. Why classes and factories provide certain state and methods\n1. Why constructors accept certain state and options\n\nThis guide explains all the core concepts, rules, and patterns that classes and factories follow. The words \"all\", \"always\", and \"never\" are displayed in bold, to emphasize the rules that apply to every single class and subclass in Baleada Logic.\n\n\n:::\n## How to construct classes and factories\n:::\n\nYou can access the functionality of **all** classes and factories by **constructing new instances** of them.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Example(...)\n```\n:::\n\nThat `...` represents the arguments you'll pass to constructor functions. The basic arguments for class constructors differ slightly from those of subclass constructors. Details are explained below.\n\n\n:::\n### Class constructors\n:::\n\n\n**All** class constructors accept two parameters:\n1. A piece of state (i.e. data—strings, arrays, objects, DOM elements, etc.),\n2. An `options` object.\n\nThe `state` parameter is **always** required, and the `options` parameter is **always** optional. Given these parameters, the constructor **always** returns an instance of itself, which **always** takes the form of an Object with state and methods.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Example(state[, options])\n\ntypeof instance // -> 'object'\n```\n:::\n\nThe `state` parameter is **always** used to pass a piece of state whose core functionality will be enhanced by the class. The `options` parameter is **always** an Object that serves as a catch-all for **all** optional parameters that affect how a class behaves.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Example(state, {\n  optionalBooleanParam: true,\n  optionalStringParam: 'baleada',\n  optionalFunctionParam: thing => doThe(thing)\n})\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n### Factory functions\n:::\n\nFactory functions accept two parameters:\n1. The piece of state that will be augmented with a new method prototype will be extended by the subclass.\n2. An `options` object.\n\nThe `state` parameter is **always** required, and the `options` parameter is **always** optional. Given these parameters, the constructor **always** returns the original `state` in Object form, with one new method added.\n\nFor example, if you pass a String, the factory will return a String object, just like you would get if you passed your string to `new String()`.\n\n:::\n```js\n// This example factory accepts a string\nconst instance = example('baleada')\n\ninstance instanceof String // -> true\ntypeof instance === 'string' // -> false\n\ninstance // -> { 0: \"b\", 1: \"a\", 2: \"l\", 3: \"e\", 4: \"a\", 5: \"d\", 6: \"a\", length: 7}\n`${instance}` // -> 'baleada'\ninstance.toString() // -> 'baleada'\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## How state and methods are made available to you\n:::\n\n:::\n### Class state and methods\n:::\n\nClasses take the form of JavaScript Objects, and **all** state and methods are accessible through the properties of those objects.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Example(state)\n\ninstance.exampleState // Access state through properties\ninstance.exampleMethod() // Access methods through properties\n```\n:::\n\nClasses methods **always** return the instance through which they were called. The benefit of this is that you can use method chaining if needed.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Example(state)\n\ninstance.exampleMethod() // -> returns instance\ninstance\n  .exampleMethod()\n  .anotherMethod()\n  .yetAnotherMethod() // -> Works 👍 and returns instance\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nClasses **always** store a shallow copy of their constructors' state in a public property named after the state's type (e.g. `string`, `array`, etc.).\n\nClasses also **always** have a public method you can use to assign a new value to that public property. The method follows a naming convention of `set<PropertyName>` (e.g. `setString`, `setArray`, etc.).\n\n:::\n```js\n// The Searchable class's constructor accepts an Array\nconst instance = new Searchable(['Baleada', 'Logic', 'Composition', 'Icons'])\n\ninstance.array // -> ['Baleada', 'Logic', 'Composition', 'Icons']\ninstance.setArray(['tortilla', 'beans', 'egg', 'avocado']) // -> returns instance\ninstance.array  // -> ['tortilla', 'beans', 'egg', 'avocado']\n```\n:::\n\nSome classes, particularly those that were designed to capture input from your end users, have additional public properties. Those classes also **always** have public methods you can use to assign a new value to the additional public properties, and those methods follow the same  `set<PropertyName>` naming convention.\n\n:::\n```js\n// The Completable class's constructor accepts a String\nconst instance = new Completable('Baleada')\n\ninstance.string // -> 'Baleada'\ninstance.location // -> 0\n\ninstance.setString('tortilla') // -> returns instance\ninstance.setLocation('3') // -> returns instance\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that public properties are writeable—it's possible to assign values to them directly. But, in some classes, certain side effects need to be performed after writing to public properties, to make sure everything keeps working properly. When this is the case, the classes' `set<PropertyName>` methods will perform **all** necessary side effects, and you won't have to think about them. Because of that, it's **always** recommended that you use the `set<PropertyName>` methods instead of writing to public properties directly.\n\n\n:::\n```js\n// The Editable class's constructor accepts state of any type\nconst instance = new Editable('Baleada')\n\ninstance.state // -> 'Baleada'\ninstance.editableState // -> 'Baleada'\n\n/*\n * It's possible to write to instance.state directly.\n * However, for Editable to work correctly, instance.editableState\n * should be edited at the same time to avoid unexpected behavior.\n */\ninstance.state = 'Logic' // -> It works\ninstance.state // -> 'Logic'\ninstance.editableState // -> 'Baleada'\n\n/*\n * If you use instance.setState instead, the required side effect\n * (updating instance.editableState) is taken care of by Editable.\n */\ninstance.setState('🌮')\ninstance.state // -> '🌮'\ninstance.editableState // -> '🌮'\n```\n:::\n\n\nOutside of `set<PropertyName>` methods, classes **never** write to their own public properties.\n\nHowever, some classes do have public methods that create mutated versions of one or more public properties' values. These classes **always** accept an `on<Method>` option, where `<Method>` is the name of the public method that mutates the values. The `on<Method>` option is **always** a function gets called after you call `instance.<Method>`, and `on<Method>` **always** accepts two parameters: the mutated value, and the instance itself (i.e. `this`).\n\nInstead of writing the mutated value to its own public property after you call `instance.<Method>`, the class will pass the mutated value as the first argument of your `on<Method>` function.\n\n\n:::\n```js\nlet totalStringCompletions = 0\n\nconst instance = new Completable('Baleada', {\n  onComplete: (completedString, instance) {\n    instance.setString(completedString)\n    totalStringCompletions++\n  }\n})\n\ninstance.string // -> 'Baleada'\ntotalStringCompletions // -> 0\n\n/*\n * When you call instance.complete, the Completable instance will create\n * a mutated version of instance.string. Then, it will call your\n * onComplete function, passing the mutated version of instance.string\n * AND itself as the two arguments.\n *\n * In this example, your onComplete function will set instance.string\n * to the new value and will mutate the external variable,\n * totalStringCompletions.\n */\ninstance.complete('Baleada: a toolkit for building web apps')\ninstance.string // -> 'Baleada: a toolkit for building web apps'\ntotalStringCompletions // -> 1\n```\n:::\n\nThese `on<Method>` functions are a great way to hook into state changes and run code just before or just after the state change actually happens. However, for ease of use, **all** classes that accept `on<Method>` functions already have sensible default functions that set state for you.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Completable('Baleada') // Completable has a default onComplete function defined for you\n\ninstance.string // -> 'Baleada'\n\n/*\n * When you call instance.complete, the Completable instance will create\n * a mutated version of instance.string. Then, it will call its default\n * onComplete function, passing the mutated version of instance.string\n * AND itself as the two arguments.\n *\n * Completable's default onComplete function will set instance.string\n * to the new value.\n */\ninstance.complete('Baleada: a toolkit for building web apps')\ninstance.string // -> 'Baleada: a toolkit for building web apps'\n```\n:::\n\n\nAll classes also have one or more public [getters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get). When you access these getters, they compute and return state that is useful for building certain UI features, but is not part of the core functionality or benefit of the class.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst instance = new Completable(\n  'Baleada: a toolkit',\n  { segmentsFromDivider: true }\n)\n\ninstance.segment // -> 'toolkit'\ninstance.segment = 'Baleada' // Doesn't work, since instance.segment is a getter\n```\n:::\n\nSome classes don't have any methods that create mutated versions of the values in their public properties. These classes **always** have one or more other public methods that expose their core functionality. These methods **never** have `on<Method>` functions associated with them, because they aren't creating any mutated state, so there is nothing valuable to pass to the functions.\n\n:::\n```js\n// The Animatable class's constructor accepts a Node or NodeList\nconst instance = new Animatable(mySelectedElement, myAnimationOptions)\n\ninstance.play() // -> Plays an animation and returns the instance, but does nothing else\n```\n:::\n\nSome classes have side effects that need to be cleaned up in order to avoid memory leaks. **All** of these classes have a public `stop` method that you can use to clean up.\n\n:::\n```js\n// Listenable can be used to listen to DOM events, media queries, Observer entries, and window idle periods.\nconst instance = new Listenable(myEventType)\n\ninstance.listen(myCallback) // -> Adds event listeners, connects observers, etc.\n\ninstance.stop() // -> Removes all listeners, disconnects all observers, etc.\n```\n:::\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nIf you use [Baleada Composition](/docs/composition) to bring Balaeda Logic into a React, Vue, or Svelte component, all side effects will be cleaned up for you automatically at the end of the component's lifecycle.\n\nSo, when you're using Baleada Composition, you never need to call the `stop` method unless you want to clean up side effects somewhere in the middle of a component's lifecycle.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n### Factory state and methods\n:::\n\nBaleada Logic's factories **never** have public state; they **always** have one method.\n\nFactories' public methods **never** mutate the original state passed to their constructors. They **always** follow three main steps:\n1. Create a mutated version of the original state\n2. Pass it to their own constructor along with any options you originally passed\n3. Return the new instance\n\nThus, factories always return a new instance of themselves, respecting any original options you passed.\n\n:::\n```js\n// Renamable is a subclass of Map that allows the map to easily rename one of its keys\nconst originalMap = [['one', 'value'], ['two', 'value']],\n      instance = new Renamable(originalMap),\n      renamedMap = instance.invoke('one', 'uno')\n\noriginalMap // -> [['one', 'value'], ['two', 'value']]\nrenamedMap // -> [['uno', 'value'], ['two', 'value']]\nrenamedMap instanceof Renamable // -> true\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Why classes & factories provide certain state and methods\n:::\n\nBaleada Logic follows a consistent process for determing which state and methods are provided by classes:\n1. Identify one action or several related actions that would be useful in a user interface. These actions become methods on the class.\n1. Identify the piece(s) of state that the action will be performed on. In other words, answer the question, \"If this method were a standalone function, what would be a required argument?\" Each answer to that question becomes a public, writeable property on the class.\n2. Identify the piece(s) of state that would be useful for building certain UI features with the class' methods and public properties, but shouldn't be considered part of the core functionality or benefit of the class. Each identified piece of state becomes a getter on the class.\n\n\n\n:::\n## Why constructors accept certain state types and options\n:::\n\n:::\n## Constructors' state types\n:::\n\nBaleada Logic uses a sentence template to decide what state type (e.g. String, Array, HTMLElement, etc.) should be accepted by a constructor:\n\n:::\n```\nA `<state type>` can be `<action>`ed (by `<action arguments>`).\n```\n:::\n\nFor example, the `Searchable` class' core action is to search/fuzzy search an array of items. The `Searchable` constructor's `state` parameter is an Array, and the class has a `search` method that accepts a search query as its only argument. This fits into the sentence template nicely:\n\n:::\n```\nAn **Array** can be **searched** by a **query**.\n```\n:::\n\nSome classes and factories have core actions that don't take arguments—in those cases, the last part of the sentence template is omitted. Take the `markupable` factory for example:\n\n:::\n```text\n**Markdown** (String) can be **marked up**.\n```\n:::\n\nThis sentence template ensures that **all** classes' and factories' methods are affordances. In other words, methods tell you what you can do with a given type of state, rather than what that type of state can do to itself or other things.\n\nIn the documentation for each individual library and subclass, you can find the filled-out sentence template, explaining why each class and subclass accepts its specific state type.\n\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nThe inspiration and motivation for this sentence template came from [Adam Wathan's \"Resisting Complexity\" talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfgtKb-VpRk).\n:::\n\n:::\n## Constructors' options\n:::\n\nConstructors only accept options that:\n- Initialize public properties\n- Customize the behavior of getter functions\n- Pass the `on<Method>` callback functions described earlier in this article\n\nConstructors **never** accept options that customize the behavior of public methods, they **always** allow those options to be passed to the method itself as a parameter.\n\n\n:::\n## Naming conventions\n:::\n\nWIP\n",

Calls your `onComplete` function, passing the completed string as the first argument and itself (i.e. `this`) as the second argument.\n2. Calls your `onLocate` function, passing the new location as the first argument and itself (i.e. `this`) as the second argument.\n\nThe default `onComplete` and `onLocate` functions, shown below, set `string` to the completed string and `location` to the new location each time you call `complete`:\n\n:::\n\n```js\n/*\n * Default onComplete function for Completable\n */\n(completedString, instance) => instance.setString(completedString)\n\n/*\n * Default onLocate function for Completable\n */\n(newLocation, instance) => instance.setLocation(newLocation)\n```\n\n:::\n\n\nWhen the Completable instance's `complete` method is called, passing a `completion` as the first parameter, Completable will create a completed version of the `string` and will compute a new value for `location`.\n\nThe completed string is a new version of the instance's `string`, with its `segment` replaced by the `completion`. After completing the `string`, the `complete` method calls your `onComplete` function, passing the completed string as the first argument.\n\nThe new value for `location` is computed based on the `locatesAfterCompletion` option, passed using the `complete` function's `options` argument:\n\n:::\n\n```js\ncompletable.complete('my completion', { locatesAfterCompletion: true })\n```\n\n:::\n\n`locatesAfterCompletion` defaults to `true`.\n\nWhen `locatesAfterCompletion` is `true`, the new location will be the the index-based location just after the end of the `completion`. This is equal to the length of any text before the `segment` plus the length of the `completion`. But, when `locatesAfterCompletion` is `false`, the new location will be equal to the old location.\n\nAfter computing the new location, the `complete` method calls your `onLocate` function, passing the new location as the first argument.\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nNote that `complete` does not set `string` or `location` to the new values, but you can do so using `setString` and `setLocation`.\n::: -->\n",

Here's a breakdown:\n\n:::\n| When `loops` is... | And the computed location is... | The new location is... |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `false` | `array.length` or greater | `array.length - 1` |\n| `false` | `-1` or less | `0` |\n| `true` | greater than `array.length - 1` | See explanation below |\n| `true` | less than `0` | See explanation below |\n:::\n\nWhen `loops` is `true` and the computed location is greater than `array.length - 1` (the largest index-based location), your Navigable instance calculates how much greater the computed location is, then takes that number of steps forward through the array, looping back to the beginning any time it passes `array.length - 1`.\n\nSee the code below for specific examples:\n\n:::\n```js\n// The loops option is true by default\nconst instance = new Navigable(['Baleada', 'Logic', 'Navigable'])\n\ninstance.goTo(2) // The array is now located at its last item\ninstance.next() // The array navigated past the end of the array, so it will return to the beginning\ninstance.location // -> 0\n\ninstance.goTo(5) // The array's largest index is 2 (indices start at 0), so going to 5 will leave 3 steps left over.\n/*\n * The array starts at 0, where it left off.\n * Your instance navigates two steps forward and reaches the last location.\n * It steps forward once more, looping around to 0.\n * It then makes its final two steps, landing on 2.\n */\ninstance.location // -> 2\n\n```\n:::\n\nWhen `loops` is `true` and the computed location is less than `0`, your Navigable instance does the same thing, but in reverse: it calculates how much less the computed location is, then takes that number of steps backward through the array, looping around to the end any time it passes `0`.\n\nSee the code below for specific examples:\n\n:::\n```js\n// The loops option is true by default\nconst instance = new Navigable(['Baleada', 'Logic', 'Navigable'])\n\ninstance.goTo(0) // The array is now located at its last item\ninstance.prev() // The array navigated past the beginning of the array, so it will loops to the end\ninstance.location // -> 2\n\ninstance.goTo(-3) // The array's lowest index is 0 (indices start at 0), so going to -3 will leave 3 steps left over.\n/*\n * The array starts at 2, where it left off.\n * Your instance navigates two steps backward and reaches 0.\n * It steps backward once more, looping around to 2.\n * It then makes its final two steps, landing on 0.\n */\ninstance.location // -> 0\n\n```\n::: -->\n",

    "body": ":::\n## UI features are composed from logic.\n:::\n\nThe big idea behind Baleada Logic, [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), the [Vue composition API](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com/), and functional programming in general is that the easiest way to create large, complex UI features is to **compose** them from smaller pieces of UI logic. Learning how to identify the discrete pieces of UI logic hidden inside of bigger UI features is the key to success with Baleada Logic.\n\n::: canTweet\n> The easiest way to create large, complex UI features is to **compose** them from smaller pieces of UI logic.\n:::\n\nFor example, imagine you want to add an autocomplete feature to your UI, so that the end user can start typing, be prompted with matching options, and pick one to automatically complete the text they were typing.\n\nAt first glance, you might think of \"autocomplete\" as the piece of UI logic you need to create, but autocomplete can actually be broken down into several smaller pieces of logic:\n:::\n1. As the user is typing, you need to extract the segment of their text that can be completed. In a simple text input, this is the entire value, but in a large text area, it's more likely to be just the current word the user is typing.\n2. You need to search a list of autocomplete options, using your segment of text as a search query. The search should fuzzy match, in case the user makes a typo.\n3. You need to display the search results in a dropdown menu on the screen. For the best user experience, the dropdown menu should reposition itself automatically, making sure that options are still visible if the user scrolls and changes the amount of available screen space.\n4. The dropdown menu should be keyboard accessible. Up and down arros keys should move options into focus. If the user is at the bottom of the list and presses the down arrow again, you should move focus back to the top of the list.\n5. When the user selects an option, you need to replace the original segment of text with the completed version.\n:::\n\nUsing tools from Baleada Logic, you would approach this list of logic like so:\n:::\n1. [`Completable`](/docs/logic/classes/completable) extracts the segment of text\n2. [`Searchable`](/docs/logic/classes/searchable) searches a list of options for the segment (fuzzy matching is optional)\n3. [`Listenable`](/docs/logic/classes/listenable) detects when the dropdown menu starts leaving the viewport, and gives you some information so that you can simply apply a CSS `transform: translate` to move the menu into a visible spot.\n4. [`Navigable`](/docs/logic/classes/navigable) tracks which option should be in focus, and can loop around to the beginning or end of the list as needed.\n5. `Completable` completes the segment of text with a completed value chosen by the user.\n:::\n\nIt might seem strange to break this feature down and implement it with so many separate tools, but this approach is what allows logic to become abstract enough to be reusable. An autocomplete feature is only useful in situations where you need to autocomplete, but a fuzzy-matching search feature is useful in all kinds of different places.\n\nAnyway, that's the basic concept, but let's explore some more concrete examples of how individual Baleada Logic tools can be reused across various UI features.\n\n\n:::\n## A simple example of reusability\n:::\n\nConsider these components, which appear in all kinds of user interfaces:\n- Carousel\n- Custom dropdown menu\n- Date picker\n- Solitaire\n\n(Ok fine, solitaire isn't common—but you'll see that a solitaire component's behavior has a lot more in common with carousels, dropdowns, and date pickers than you might think!)\n\nVisually, these components are so different that it feels clean and correct to build them all in isolation, or install isolated packages that contain them. But if you look more closely, these components share a decent number of different behaviors:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Behaviors that carousels, dropdowns, date pickers, and solitaire have in common\"\n\n| Behavior | Carousel | Dropdown | Date picker | Solitaire |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Click a button or use an arrow key to move backward or forward | yes | yes | yes | yes |\n| Loop back to the beginning after navigating forwards past the last item | usually | yes | N/A  | yes |\n| Loop back to the end after navigating backwards past the first item | usually | yes | N/A | no |\n| Go to a specific item | yes | not usually | yes | no |\n| Move forward and back in custom increments | yes, if the carousel displays more than 1 image at a time | no | yes | yes (3-card or 1-card advance) |\n| Go to a random item | sometimes | no | sometimes | no |\n\n:::\n\nAcross each of these components, the code that implements this collection of array-navigating behaviors is more or less the same. But when you're using Baleada Logic, you don't have to write or install the same array-navigating code separately for each one of those components.\n\nInstead, you just build your array of images, dropdown options, years/months/days, or playing cards, and you pass the array to the constructor of `Navigable`—one of Baleada Logic's classes—to create an instance of the `Navigable` class.\n\nThe `Navigable` class has all the methods you need to navigate forward, backward, to a specific item, or even to a random item. Its methods for moving forward and backward can handle custom increments (e.g. moving forward 3 cards in solitaire) and can loop around to the beginning or end of the array (both features are optional based on parameters you pass to the method when it's called).\n\nArray navigation is on the simpler end of the UI logic spectrum, but it's a great example of logic that can easily get tangled up and repeated inside seemingly unrelated components instead of being extracted into something more reusable and feature-complete.\n\n::: canTweet\n> Array navigation is a great example of logic that can easily get tangled up and repeated inside seemingly unrelated components instead of being extracted into something more reusable and feature-complete.\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## A more complex example of reusability\n:::\n\nFor something more complex, imagine you're building the following components:\n- Custom image component for a social networking app\n- A sidebar navigation menu for a documentation site\n- A message in an inbox\n- A wrapper component (or maybe just a plain function) that detects user mouse movements, computes analytics, and sends the analytics to a server\n\nThese components are wildly different, but let's double-check some of the behaviors these components should have, to see if we can find similarities:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"Behaviors that image components and navigation menus need\"\n\n| Behavior | Custom image | Sidebar nav | Inbox message | Analytics wrapper |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Don't load the resource until the element is visible | yes | no | it's possible | no |\n| Do something when the user hits a specific keystroke | no | yes (toggle dark mode) | yes (reply all, compose new message, etc.) | no |\n| Do something when the user moves the mouse | no | no | no | yes (store mouse position for analytics) |\n| Do something when the user double taps | yes (\"like\" the image) | no | probably not | no |\n| Do something when the user swipes right | yes (initiate mating sequence) | yes (on mobile, open the menu) | yes (archive the message) | no |\n| Do something when the user is idle | no | no | yes (save draft reply) | yes (compute and send analytics) |\n\n:::\n\nHmm...okay, it looks like some of these behaviors overlap, but not that closely.\n\nNotice, however, that every single one of these behaviors has a similar structure: when something specific happens, take an action. To be more precise: when an event or combination of events is fired, execute a callback function.\n\nIf you were writing all of this behavior yourself across each of these components, you would most likely use:\n:::\n- An [Intersection Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/intersectionObserver)\n- A third-party [gesture recognition library](https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch/) that supports \"swipe right\" and \"double tap\"\n- [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)\n- [`requestIdleCallback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback) (to keep your analytics work off the main thread so that it doesn't slow down other processes)\n:::\n\nYou would also need to make sure that, when the components reach the end of their lifecycle:\n:::\n- The Intersection Observer disconnects from the images\n- The gesture recognizer is properly destroyed (hopefully the third party library has that option)\n- You execute [`removeEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener) for each corresponding `addEventListener`\n- You execute [`cancelIdleCallback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/cancelIdleCallback) for each corresponding `requestIdleCallback`\n:::\n\nAll that work and all of those APIs...just to make your app do something after something else happens!\n\nWith Baleada Logic, you would instead follow a straightforward process:\n1. Identify the name of the \"something\" that you're waiting for. For the components above, the \"somethings\" would be `'keydown'` `'intersect'`, `'tap'`, `'swipe'`, and `'idle'`.\n1. Pass the name of each \"something\" to a `Listenable` constructor to create instances of the `Listenable` class.\n1. Call your `Listenable` instances' `listen` methods, passing a callback function to each one that will triggers the appropriate action when its \"something\" happens. (You can also pass options to `listen`, for example, to make sure that you are only listening for an event on a specific element instead of the whole page.)\n1. Wait for your events to happen, and rest easy knowing that your callbacks will all run at the appropriate time!\n1. At the end of the components' lifecycles, call the `stop` method on your instances to stop all listening and observing (therefore avoiding memory leaks).\n\nThe idea behind `Listenable` is, that, at the end of the day, you shouldn't have to know or care whether the right tool to listen for any given \"something\" is an Observer, a magical gesture recognition library, the somewhat obscure `requestIdleCallback`, or good old `addEventListener`, and you _definitely_ shouldn't have to know or care about how to clean up side effects and avoid memory leaks with each tool.\n\nThese tools, as nifty as they are, are implementation details in their truest form. Their inconsistent APIs are the _last_ thing you should be worrying about when all you really need is to add that \"do something when something else happens\" behavior to your project.\n\n\n:::\n## A sweeping conclusion\n:::\n\nThe purpose of Baleada Logic is to abstract repetitive but relatively complex UI logic into something more reusable, so that you can focus on the aesthetics and business logic of your project instead of fiddling with web APIs, doing algebra, performing basic state management, getting into the weeds with `this`, remembering where and how to use all the methods of native prototypes, etc.\n\n::: canTweet\n> The purpose of Baleada Logic is to abstract repetitive but relatively complex UI logic into something more reusable, so that you can focus on the aesthetics and business logic of your project.\n:::\n\nBaleada's abstractions take the form of **JavaScript classes** and **factory functions**. These classes and factories do several important things:\n:::\n- They expose a consistent, unified, intuitive API, regardless of what behaviors and feature you're trying to add to your poject\n- They avoid side effects in the DOM whenever possible, and when not possible, they offer a consistent API for cleaning up afterward\n- The _only_ assumption they make about your DOM is that you have one. And sometimes, they don't even assume that!\n- They offer an intentionally limited set of features and functionality. In your project, any component worth its salt won't be powered by a single Baleada Logic class or factory—instead, your components will compose features using more than one class or factory, sometimes even feeding state from one class into the methods of another.\n:::\n<!-- TODO: more stuff for that list? Clarify benefits? -->\n\nIf you're ready to get your hands dirty, check out the docs listed on the left for individual Baleada Logic classes and factories.\n\nIf you really want to nerd out on the API design, check out the [API design guide](/docs/logic/api-design).\n",

However, the number one priority during Baleada's development was to add useful state and methods to websites and apps that are built on reactivity & component frameworks like Vue, React, or Svelte and bundled using Webpack, Rollup, or something similar.\n\nIn most cases, it's recommended that you use [Baleada Composition](/docs/composition) inside the framework & build chain of your choice instead of importing classes and factories directly from Baleada Logic.\n\nBaleada Composition has a dedicated composition function for each individual Baleada Logic class, plus composition functions that combine Baleada Logic classes to implement common UI patterns (think autocompletes, toasts, forms that auto-save, etc.).\n\nIf you're planning to use Baleada Composition, you won't need to know how to install and import classes and factories directly from Baleada Logic, but you'll still need to know how to use individual classes and factories. A great place to start is the [Identifying UI Logic](/docs/logic/identifying-ui-logic) guide, which will teach you core concepts and patterns that will help you use Baleada Logic's classes and factories successfully.\n\nAll of that said, the number _two_ priority during Baleada's development was to ensure it's still perfectly possible to use Baleada Logic in simpler projects, built with smaller JavaScript frameworks or no framework at all. If that sounds like your use case, keep reading! (And definitely check out the [Identifying UI Logic](/docs/logic/identifying-ui-logic) guide afterward.)\n\n\n:::\n## Install\n:::\n\n:::\n```bash\nnpm i @baleada/logic\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Import a class or factory\n:::\n\nAll classes are named exports in Baleada Logic's entry file, so you can import one like so:\n\n\n:::\n```js\nimport { Delayable } from '@baleada/logic'\n```\n:::\n\nFactories are named exports in a `factories.js` file at the root of Baleada Logic, so you can import one like so:\n\n:::\n```js\nimport { markupable } from '@baleada/logic/factories'\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Available classes and factories\n:::\n\nAll available classes and factories are listed in this site's navigation under **LOGIC** and linked to their specific documentation.\n\n\n:::\n## Language, compilation, browser support, and dependencies\n:::\n\nClasses and factories are written in modern JavaScript, and almost all of them have no dependencies of their own. They are compiled by [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to work in browsers that are used by more than 0.5% of global web visitors AND have had official support or updates in the past 24 months.\n\nTo allow for [tree-shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/), Baleada Logic's compiled code has no side effects and uses [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [`export`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) instead of [`require()`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_id) and [`module.exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports).\n\nDependencies, when they exist, were chosen with the following desirable characteristics in mind (in no particular order):\n- Framework agnostic\n- Few or no dependencies of their own\n- Small file size\n- Tree-shakeable\n- Small impact on apps' bundle size\n- Industry standard\n- Recommended/used by proficient, well-known, independent developers\n\nNot all dependencies meet every single one of those requirements. However, lots of care was taken to ensure that, if a dependency can be replaced by something better in the future, doing so will be quick and easy, and with any luck, won't result in breaking changes.\n",

For example:\n:::\n- Allowing the user to enter a search term and see a list of search results, filtered based on fuzzy matches\n- Autocompleting text, replacing all or part of the original text with a completed value\n- Detecting and reacting to common gestures (pan, swipe, double-tap, drag, drag-and-drop, etc.)\n:::\n\nTo complicate matters, those special behaviors will definitely need to be repeated and reused across projects, and even within the same project. To avoid spending all your time copy/pasting from project to project, fixing the same bug in 10 different places, and constantly reinventing the wheel, you'll need to find a way to **reuse your UI logic**.\n\nThere are several common solutions for making UI logic reusable, each with their pros and cons:\n\n:::\n\n| Solution | Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Big, custom components that handle everything—HTML structure, CSS styles, and UI logic | <ul><li>Great for quick-fix, plug-and-play use cases.</li><li>Great if you can build a limited selection of components that get shared and used frequently.</li><li>Doesn't require that you (the developer consuming this solution) understand how `this` works.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Usually accept massive amounts of props that you need to learn in order to customize any given detail.</li><li>Usually the wrong abstraction—it makes a specific application of UI logic reusable, but fails at making the underlying logic reusable.</li><li>Not really possible unless you're using a component framework like React, Vue, Svelte, etc.</li></ul> |\n| [Mixins](https://javascript.info/mixins) | <ul><li>Pretty intuitive approach: at the end of the day, it's just merging new properties into an object.</li><li>It's a general JavaScript technique that can be used outside of component frameworks</li></ul> | <ul><li>Leads to naming collisions between injected state and methods</li><li>Leads to broken components after the name of a mixed in property or method changes</li><li>Requires that you (the developer consuming this solution) have some understanding of how `this` works.</li></ul> |\n| [Renderless](https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/)/[Higher order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) | <ul><li>Effectively reuses logic without risk of naming collisions</li><li>Can be made highly customizable with only a few props</li></ul>  | <ul><li>Creates deeply nested component trees that are confusing to write and even harder to read.</li><li>Pretty difficult to pass state and methods down through nested renderless components to where it actually needs to be.</li><li>Not really possible unless you're using a component framework like React, Vue, Svelte, etc.</li><li>Usually requires that you (the developer consuming this solution) have some understanding of how `this` works.</li></ul> |\n\n:::\n\nAll of those solutions work to an extent, but their downsides are uncomfortable, and things only get worse as projects grow bigger. Also, real-world examples of these solutions are almost always implemented for just one reactivity & component framework, with no chance of working inside another framework without rewriting and maintaining a fully separate version.\n\nWith the introduction of [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and the [Vue composition API](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com), however, it has become possible to\n",

    "body": "Baleada Markdown-it SPA Links is a [Markdown-it](https://markdown-it.github.io/) plugin that uses the correct link component to render links to other pages in your single-page app.\n\nFor example, if you're using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), you can write the following Markdown:\n\n:::\n```\n[My other page](/my-other-page)\n```\n:::\n\nAnd it will be rendered as:\n\n:::\n```html\n<p><NuxtLink to=\"/my-other-page\">My other page</NuxtLink></p>\n```\n:::\n\nThe plugin supports link components for the following tools:\n- [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com)\n- [Next](https://nextjs.org)\n- [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org)\n- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)\n- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)\n\n::: type=\"info\"\n[Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) was originally on the list of supported link components as well, but since [Sapper links are simply `<a>` elements](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Comparison_with_Next_js) instead of specific components, special rendering is not necessary.\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Installation\n:::\n\nYou can install Baleada Markdown-it SPA Links from NPM.\n\n:::\n```bash\nnpm i @baleada/markdown-it-spa-links\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Usage\n:::\n\nTo get started, import the plugin from the entry file of `@baleada/markdown-it-spa-links`, and create a Markdown-it instance.\n\n:::\n```js\nimport MarkdownItSpaLinks from '@baleada/markdown-it-spa-links'\nimport MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it'\n\nconst md = new MarkdownIt()\n```\n:::\n\nUse the `use` method of your Markdown-it instance to register the plugin.

    "body": "Baleada Tailwind Linear is a function that returns configurations from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)'s [default config file](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/blob/master/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js), aliasing all class names so that they use a linear numeric naming convention.\n\nBy default, it produces class names like the following:\n- `.text-400` instead of `.text-base`\n- `.font-100` instead of `.font-hairline`\n- `.mt-800`, `.mt-900`, and `.mt-1000`, instead of `.mt-10`, `.mt-12`, and `.mt-16`\n\nIt can be customized to produce classes like `.text-4` instead of `.text-400`.\n\nIf you're familiar with the concept of a linear numeric naming convention in Tailwind, you can [jump to the Installation section](#installation). Otherwise, the next section has some helpful background info\n\n:::\n## WTF is a \"linear numeric naming convention\"?\n:::\n\nTailwind uses a few different naming conventions for its utility classes. Some properties use \"T-shirt sizes\" in their class names. For example, here are the default [font size](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size) classes:\n- `.text-xs`\n- `.text-sm`\n- `.text-base`\n- `.text-lg`\n- `.text-xl`\n- `.text-2xl`\n- `.text-3xl`\n- `.text-4xl`\n- `.text-5xl`\n- `.text-6xl`\n\nOther classes, like the ones for font weight, use more semantic words:\n- `.font-hairline`\n- `.font-thin`\n- `.font-light`\n- `.font-normal`\n- `.font-medium`\n- `.font-semibold`\n- `.font-bold`\n- `.font-extrabold`\n- `.font-black`\n\nSpacing utilities ([margin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin), [padding](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding), [width](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width), and [height](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/height)), use proportional numeric names. This means that the classes are suffixed with numbers that are proportional to the underlying values.\n\nSpacing utilities multiply the underlying `rem` value by 4 to derive the class name. Here are a few examples from the padding utilities:\n- `.p-1` for `0.25rem`\n- `.p-5` for `1.25rem`\n- `.p-24` for `6rem`\n- `.p-64` for `16rem`\n\nAnd finally, Tailwind's [color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/color) utilities use a **linear numeric naming convention**. This means that all class suffixes are numbers that increment linearly from one value to the next:\n- `.bg-blue-100`\n- `.bg-blue-200`\n- `.bg-blue-300`\n- `.bg-blue-400`\n- `.bg-blue-500`\n- `.bg-blue-600`\n- `.bg-blue-700`\n- `.bg-blue-800`\n- `.bg-blue-900`\n\n**T-shirt**, **semantic**, **proportional numeric**, and **linear numeric**—all four naming conventions have their pros and cons. Baleada Tailwind Linear will help you explore the pros and cons of linear numeric class names in your own projects.\n\n:::\n## Installation\n:::\n\nBaleada Tailwind Linear can be installed from NPM:\n\n:::\n```bash\nnpm i @baleada/tailwind-linear --save-dev\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Usage\n:::\n\nTo get started, require `@baleada/tailwind-linear` in your [Tailwind config file](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration). The default export is a function, which we'll call `tailwindLinear` in this example.\n\n:::\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst tailwindLinear = require('@baleada/tailwind-linear')\n```\n:::\n\nThe `tailwindLinear` returns configurations for the following properties of the `theme` object in your config file:\n- `spacing`\n- `borderRadius`\n- `borderWidth`\n- `boxShadow`\n- `fontSize`\n- `fontWeight`\n- `letterSpacing`\n- `lineHeight`\n- `maxWidth`\n- `colors`\n\nThe function accepts one parameter: an object with options (none of which are required). Here's a full breakdown of that object:\n\n::: ariaLabel=\"tailwindLinear options schema\"\n| Property | Value's type | Default | Value description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `only` | Array of Strings | An array of all the properties listed above | Indicates which properties' configurations should be returned by `tailwindLinear`. |\n| `increment` | Number | `100` | <p>Determines how much the class name is incremented for each step up in size.</p><p>For example, if you pass `1` as the `increment`, you'll get class names like `.text-4` and `.text-5` instead of the default `.text-400` and `.text-500`.</p> |\n:::\n\nIf you want to use linear numeric naming for all of these properties, simply spread the output of `tailwindLinear` into your config file.\n\n:::\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst tailwindLinear = require('@baleada/tailwind-linear')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    ...tailwindLinear() // Overrides the default theme (only the properties listed above)\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nIf you only want to use linear numeric naming for some properties, use the `only` option to restrict your list.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst tailwindLinear = require('@baleada/tailwind-linear')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    ...tailwindLinear({ only: ['spacing'] }) // Overrides the default theme's spacing values, but you'll still get default classes (e.g. .shadow-md) for other properties\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: type=\"info\"\nThe default configurations for margin, padding, height, and width all reference your `spacing` object. Including `spacing` in your `tailwindLinear` output will adjust all of those utility classes.\n:::\n\nTo customize the increment that gets used in your class names, use the `increment` option.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst tailwindLinear = require('@baleada/tailwind-linear')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    ...tailwindLinear({ increment: 1 }) // Produces classes like .text-4 and .text-5 instead of the default .text-400 and .text-500\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nYou can call `tailwindLinear` as many times as you want, so feel free to use the `only` and `increment` options to fine tune class names for individual properties.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst tailwindLinear = require('@baleada/tailwind-linear')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    ...tailwindLinear({ only: ['fontSize'], increment: 1 }), // .text-4, .text-5, etc.\n    ...tailwindLinear({ only: ['fontWeight'] }) // .font-400, .font-500, etc.\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nAll configurations returned by `tailwindLinear` are plain JavaScript objects, so you can also spread them out alongside any additional custom values you want to add.\n\nJust remember that you'll have to tack on the property name after your function call to make sure you're spreading your desired configuration object, instead of the parent object `tailwindLinear` returns.\n\n:::\n```js\nconst tailwindLinear = require('@baleada/tailwind-linear')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    borderWidth: {\n      '550': '3px',\n      ...tailwindLinear({ only: ['borderWidth'] }).borderWidth,\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nTo expand on that concept: `tailwindLinear` returns a full colors object for the `colors` property. If you want to access a single color, you can tack on `.colors` and the color name right after your function call:\n\n:::\n```js\nconst tailwindLinear = require('@baleada/tailwind-linear')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    colors: {\n      blue: tailwindLinear({ only: ['colors'], increment: 1 }).colors.blue,\n      gray: {\n        ...tailwindLinear({ only: ['colors'] }).colors.gray,\n        '1000': 'hsla(217, 30%, 8%, 1.0)',\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n## Naming convention rules\n:::\n\nOk, so Baleada Tailwind Linear uses linear numeric names—but where does the numbering start? How are \"default\" classes handled?\n\nBaleada Tailwind Linear follows the rules below, in their exact order, to answer those questions individually for each property:\n1. Properties that already have linear numeric names (just color, at the moment) are not changed from their original naming scheme, except to support different increments using `tailwindLinear`'s `increment` option.\n1. Anything with an underlying value of `0` or `none` (e.g. `.tracking-normal` and `shadow-none`) is named with the number `0`.\n\n    Then, starting at the `0` class, Baleada Tailwind Linear increments in both directions, both negative and positive. Note that keys like `-100` in the config file will create classes like `.-tracking-100`.\n1. If there is no `0` value for the property, but there is a value assigned to a `default`, `normal`, or `base` key, Baleada Tailwind Linear renames default/normal/base with `400`. This follows the CSS convention of using `400` for normal font weight.\n\n    Then, Baleada Tailwind Linear increments in both directions from the `400` class. Note that this sometimes results in certain properties (e.g. `borderWidth`) having `400` classes, but not having classes for `100`, `200`, or `300`.\n\n    Tailwind's `.shadow-inner` is treated as a default negative shadow, and is assigned a key of `-400` (which produces the class `.-shadow-400`).\n1. Proportions (e.g. `full: 100%`) and key words (e.g. `auto`) are left unchanged.\n2. If the unit (e.g. `px`) is specified in the class, it's left unchanged.\n\nOnce you get used to the naming convention, you'll find that classes become very easy to guess without visiting your config file or these docs.\n\nBut, if you have any doubts, check out the [class references](/docs/tailwind-linear/class-references) to see classes are being generated for each property, and how they match up with the original Tailwind classes.\n\nAlso, feel free to peruse the [full default config](/docs/tailwind-linear/default-config) that `tailwindLinear` returns.\n",

Baleada provides UI logic for specific behaviors that are commonly needed, but can be complex to implement in a reusable way.\n\nFor example:\n:::\n- Allowing the user to enter a search term, query an array of strings or objects, and receive a list of search results based on fuzzy matches\n- Autocompleting text, replacing all or part of the original text with a completed value\n- Detecting and reacting to common gestures (pan, swipe, double-tap, drag, drag-and-drop, etc.), or even custom gestures that you define\n:::\n\nTo get started with Baleada's logic, check out the [Baleada Logic](/docs/logic) package.\n\n:::\n## Composition functions (a.k.a. hooks)\n:::\n\n\"Composition function\" is a term coined by the [Vue](https://vuejs.org) team to describe functions that **collocate code** related to the same logical concern. In [React](https://react.org), these functions are called \"hooks\", but the concept and motivations are virtually the same.\n\nBaleada's composition functions collocate **reactivity** code with **UI logic** code. More specifically, each Baleada composition function retrieves state and methods from one or more of the Baleada Logic tools, then makes all of the state reactive, using tools from the JavaScript framework of your choice.\n\nTo get started with Baleada's composition functions, check out the [Baleada Composition](/docs/composition) package.\n\n:::\n## Icon components\n:::\n\nThere are [tons of reasons](http://www.fullstackradio.com/47) to use **true SVG icons** instead of icon fonts. But copy/pasting SVG markup all over your website or app is tedious, not readable, and not maintainable.\n\nIf you're using a component framework like Vue, React, or Svelte, the clear solution is to wrap up your SVG icons in reusable components, so that you get all the benefits of SVGs while writing efficient code.\n\nBaleada's icon components do just that! To get started with them, check out the [Baleada Icons](/docs/icons) package.\n",
