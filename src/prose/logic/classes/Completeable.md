`Completeable` is a class that enriches a string, allowing it to:
  - Store a current text selection
  - Extract a segment of itself
  - Replace the segment or the full string with a completed string, and automatically update the text selection afterward

## Construct a `Completeable` instance
:::

The `Completeable` constructor accepts two parameters:

::: ariaLabel="Completeable constructor parameters" classes="wide-4"
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `string` | String | yes | The string that will be made completable. |
| `options` | Object | no | Options for the `Completeable` instance. See the [Completeable constructor options](#Completeable-constructor-options) section for more guidance. |

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `segment` | Object | `{ from: 'start', to: 'end' }` | Controls how the `Completeable` instance will extract segments. See the [How the `Completeable` instance extracts segments](#how-the-completeable-instance-extracts-segments) section for more guidance. |

### How the `Completeable` instance extracts segments
:::

`Completeable`'s internal workflow is:
1. Analyze the `string` to determine what portion of text (the `segment`) should be replaced if you call the `complete` method.
2. When the `complete` method is called, replace the `segment` with the `completion` passed as the first argument to the `complete` method.

When analyzing the `string`, your `Completeable` instance is specifically looking for two pieces of information:
1. The index-based position (Number) of the **start** of the `segment`
1. The index-based position (Number) of the **end** of the `segment`

And the factors that influence that analysis are:
1. The `from` and `to` properties of the `options.segment` option passed to the constructor
2. The `options.divider` option passed to the constructor, although this is only relevant when `options.segment.from` OR `options.segment.to` were set to `'divider'`
3. The `start` and `end` properties of the current `selection` object

Here are breakdowns of exactly how each of those factors impacts `Completeable`'s calculation of the `segment` start and end indices:

::: ariaLabel="breakdown of how segment.from impacts segment start index" class="wide-2"
| Value of `segment.from` | Impact on `segment`'s start index |
| --- | --- |
| `start` | `segment`'s start index is always `0` |
| `selection` | `segment`'s start index is always equal to `selection.start` |
| `divider` | <p>To find the start index, `Completeable` goes to the `selection.start` position and steps backward through the `string`, one character at a time, looking for a match to the regular expression passed to `options.divider` (`/\s/` by default).</p><p>The start index of the `segment` is the match's index plus one. If no match is found, the segment's start index will be `0`.</p><p>The match's index also gets stored in `dividerIndices.before` in case you need to reference it, or use it in debugging.</p> |
:::

::: ariaLabel="breakdown of how segment.to impacts segment end index" class="wide-2"
| Value of `segment.to` | Impact on `segment`'s end index |
| --- | --- |
| `end` | `segment`'s end index is always the length of the `string` minus one. |
| `selection` | `segment`'s end index is always equal to `selection.end` |
| `divider` | <p>To find the end index, `Completeable` goes to the `selection.end` position and steps forward through the `string`, one character at a time, looking for a match to the regular expression passed to `options.divider` (`/\s/` by default).</p><p>The end index of the `segment` is the match's index minus one. If no match is found, the segment's end index will be the length of the `string` minus one.</p><p>The match's index also gets stored in `dividerIndices.after` in case you need to reference it, or use it in debugging.</p> |
:::

Finally, to finish extracting the `segment`, `Completeable` slices the `string` from the start index through the end index.

::: type="info"
`segment` is computed each time it is accessed, using a getter.

:::
### How the `Completeable` instance completes strings and computes new selections
:::

As mentioned above, the `complete` method accepts two parameters: `completion` and `options`.

`completion` should be a completed piece of text that will replace the `segment` within the `string` (or the entire string, if you haven't changed the default constructor options).

`options` is an object, with just one property. Here's a breakdown:

::: ariaLabel="complete options" classes="wide-4"
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `select` | String | `completion` | <p>Controls how `Completeable` will set the new selection after completing text. Valid values are `completion` or `completionEnd`.</p><p>If `options.select` is `completion`, `Completeable` will set `selection.start` to the start index of the completed text, and `selection.end` to the end index of the completed text.</p><p>If `options.select` is `completionEnd`, `Completeable` will set both `selection.start` and `selection.end` to the end index of the completed text.</p> |
