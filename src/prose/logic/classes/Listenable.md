`Listenable` is a class that enriches an event type (including observation types, media queries, custom gestures, and more), allowing it to:
- Listen for that event type and execute a callback function when it occurs
- Retrieve a list of active listeners that it has added
- Store a status (`ready`, `listening`, or `stopped`)
- Easily clean up all listening activity to avoid memory leaks


:::
## Example
:::

Baleada's docs use `Listenable` to:
- Toggle the dark theme when you press `Shift` + `D`
- Toggle the minimalist theme when you press `Shift` + `M`
- Set your default theme (dark or light) based on your device's [color theme preference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
- On mobile, open and close the sidebar nav and table of contents when you swipe right or left


:::
## Construct a `Listenable` instance
:::

The `Listenable` constructor accepts two parameters:

::: ariaLabel="Listenable constructor parameters" classes="wide-4"
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | String | yes | The type of event that will be made listenable. See the [Valid event types](#valid-event-types) section for more guidance. |
| `options` | Object | no | Options for the `Listenable` instance. See the [`Listenable` constructor options](#Listenable-constructor-options) section for more guidance. |
:::


:::
### Valid event types
:::

`Listenable` supports a ton of different event types and can deduce which web APIs to use under the hood based on the `type` you pass. 

Most of the time, you don't need to be concerned with exactly which web API is being used, and you can think of it as an implementation detail.

But in certain cases where you want to customize the way a specific web API behaves, you'll need to know which API is being used in order to know what customization options are available.

You'll find more guidance down below, in the [How to customize `listen` behavior](#how-to-customize-listen-behavior) section.

The table below has a breakdown of valid event types, the corresponding web APIs that `Listenable` uses under the hood, and the main purpose of the API.

### How to handle events
:::

Depending on your `type`, your `effect`â€”passed as the required first argument of the `listen` methodâ€”will receive different parameters.

The table below has a full breakdown of what the `listen` method passes to your `effect` for each specific event type:

::: ariaLabel="List of event types and the arguments your effect will receive" class="wide-2"
| `type` | What your `effect` receives |
| --- | --- |

### How to customize `listen` behavior
:::

The `listen` method accepts an optional second parameter, which is an Object whose properties customize the behavior of the web APIs `Listenable` uses under the hood.

Depending on your `type` only certain properties will have an effect.

First, here's a breakdown of what each `options` property does, and below that, in the [Available options for each `type`](#available-options-for-each-type) section, you'll find a table of which properties can be used for each `type`:

::: ariaLabel="listen method options" class="wide-4"
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `target` | HTMLElement, Document | See [Default values for `target` based on `type`](#default-values-for-target-based-on-type) | The target that will listen for events |
| `addEventListener` | Object | none | The `options` parameter of [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) |
| `useCapture` | Boolean | none | A value for the standalone `useCapture` parameter of [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). Ignored if an `addEventListener` object was passed. |
| `wantsUntrusted` | Boolean | none | A value for the standalone `wantsUntrusted` parameter of [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) |
| `except` | Array | `[]` | <p>An array of DOM elements that, if they are the target of the event, should *not* cause your `effect` to be executed.</p><p>When the `only` option is a non-empty array, `except` is ignored.</p> |
| `only` | Array | `[]` | <p>An array of DOM elements that, if they are the target of the event, *should* cause your `effect` to be executed.</p><p>When `only` is a non-empty array, `except` is ignored.</p><p>An empty `only` array is ignored (otherwise, the `effect` would never execute).</p> |
| `observer` | Object | none | The `options` parameter of the [Intersection Observer constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver) |
| `observe` | Object | none | The `options` parameter of the [`MutationObserver.observe`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver/observe) and [`ResizeObserver.observe`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver/observe) methods |
| `requestIdleCallback` | Object | none | The `options` parameter of [`requestIdleCallback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback) |
| `keyDirection` | String | `down` | <p>Indicates which keyboard event should be listened to when detecting keycombos. Valid options are `down` and `up` .</p><p>The `keyDirection` option only has an effect when your `type` is a keycombo, as described the [How to format combos](#how-to-format-combos).</p> |

### How to listen for custom gestures
:::

`Listenable` allows you to listen for custom gestures defined by Baleada Logic's `Recognizeable` class. For full information on how to use the `Recognizeable` class, [visit the `Recognizeable` docs](/docs/logic/classes/Recognizeable) (especially the [section on constructor options](/docs/logic/classes/Recognizeable#recognizeable-constructor-options) and the [section on accessing state and methods](/docs/logic/classes/Recognizeable#access-state-and-methods)), but keep reading here to learn the overall workflow.

To get started, construct a new instance of `Listenable`, using `recognizeable` as the `type`, and passing the [`Recognizeable` options object](/docs/logic/classes/Recognizeable#Recognizeable-constructor-options) to the `recognizeable` option:

:::
```js
const instance = new Listenable('recognizeable', {
  recognizeable: {...} // See the Recognizeable docs for all available options
})
```
:::

Using that, `Listenable` will construct a new instance of `Recognizeable`, passing an empty array as the first argument (where `Recognizeable` stores the event sequence) and your `recognizeable` object as the second argument (the `options` argument).

`Listenable` will store your constructed `Recognizeable` instance in its `recognizeable` property:

:::
```js
const instance = new Listenable('recognizeable', { recognizeable: {...} })

instance.recognizeable instanceof Recognizeable // -> true
```
:::

::: type="info"
Not sure what to pass to `options.recognizeable.effects`?

Don't sweat itâ€”check out the [Baleada Recognizeable Effects](/docs/recognizeable-effects) package, which gives you access to pre-built `effects` objects for commonly needed gestures:
- `clicks` (i.e. double-clicks, triple-clicks, etc.)
- `touches` (touch equivalent of `clicks`)
- `mousedrag`
- `mousedragdrop`
- `touchdrag`
- `touchdragdrop`
- `pinch`
- `press`
- `rotate`
:::

When you call the `listen` method, passing your `effect` function, `Listenable` will add an event listener for each of the event types specified by `options.recognizeable.effects`.

As events occur, `Listenable` will pass them through to your `Recognizeable` instance's `recognize` method, which in turn will pass the events to the `Recognizeable` instance's side effect functions.

When your `Recognizeable` instance recognizes a gesture, Listenable will execute your `effect`. Your `effect` will receive the latest item in the sequence tracked by `Recognizeable`. More commonly, though, you'll be reaching into the `Recognizeable` instance to access its `metadata`â€”i.e., you'll be accessing `instance.recognizeable.metadata`.


:::
#### Complete custom gesture example
:::

The following real-world code shows how this Baleada documentation site combines `Listenable` and `Recognizeable` with custom effects from [Baleada Recognizeable Effects](/docs/recognizeable-effects) to open and close the sidebar navigation and table of contents when a mobile device user swipes left or right.

The original code is written specifically to work with [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org), but this example has been simplified to plain JavaScript, and heavily commented.

[Here's an editable demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/baleada-logic-listenable-gesture-workflow?file=entry.ts) where you can tinker with similar code.

:::
```js
import { Listenable } from '@baleada/logic'
// The touchdragdrop effects are a great stand-in for swipe
// gesture recognition.
import { touchdragdrop as swipe } from '@baleada/recognizeable-effects'

// Construct the Listenable instance, passing custom effects
// to options.recognizeable.effects
const articleSwipe = new Listenable(
  'recognizeable',
  { recognizeable: { effects: swipe() } }
)

articleSwipe.listen(
  // In the listen effect, access the Recognizeable instance's
  // metadata to make a change in the UI.
  () => {
    const direction = articleSwipe.recognizeable.metadata.direction.fromStart

    switch (direction) {
      case 'right':
        openNav()
        break
      case 'left':
        openTableOfContents()
        break
    }
  },
  // Add a few options to customize listen behavior
  {
    // Only the article element, not the entire document,
    // should listen for a swipe gesture
    target: document.querySelector('article'),
    // Elements with a .swiper-no-swiping class are not
    // valid swipe targets, even if they are inside the
    // article. This is useful for ignoring horizontal
    // scrolling on tables and codeblocks in the docs,
    // since the scrolling gesture is physically the same
    // movement as a swipe, and would normally get recognized.
    except: ['.swiper-no-swiping'],
    // For performance reasons, set `passive` to `true`
    // to prevent the effect from running on the main
    // thread when the user is scrolling on a touch-enabled
    // device.
    addEventListener: { passive: true }
  }
)
```
:::


:::
## Using with TypeScript
:::

`Listenable` will type check your `listen` method `effect` functions and options based on the `type` (String) you pass to the constructor:

:::
```ts
const instance = new Listenable('intersect')

instance.listen(
  // Listenable knows that `entries` is an array of
  // IntersectionObserverEntry objects.
  //
  // entries[0].boundingClientRect.width can be accessed via
  // IDE autocomplete!
  entries => console.log(entries[0].boundingClientRect.width),
  // Listenable also knows that the `listen` method for an
  // 'intersect' type can accept an `observer` option,
  // passing an IntersectionObserverInit object.
  { observer: { threshold: 0.5 } }
) 
```
:::

Even complex types like combos and media queries will be detected:

:::
```ts
const screenSize = new Listenable('(min-width: 420px)')
screenSize.listen(
  // TypeScript knows that this is a MediaQueryListEvent
  event => doSomething(event)
)

const cmdRightclick = new Listenable('cmd+rightclick')
cmdRightclick.listen(
  // TypeScript knows that this is a MouseEvent
  event => doSomething(event),
  // TypeScript also knows what options are available
  { target: document.querySelector('canvas') }
)

const shiftB = new Listenable('shift+b')
shiftB.listen(
  // TypeScript knows that this is a KeyboardEvent
  event => doSomething(event)
)
```
:::

There are two situations where you'll need to adopt a little bit of type unsafety:
1. When listening for combos that have no modifiers
2. When using `Listenable` to configure a `Recognizeable` instance for recognizing a custom gesture

Let's talk through these two cases individually, and how to minimize type unsafety.

Here's an annotated code example for the first case:

:::
```ts
// In this example, we want to listen for the 'b' key.
//
// Listenable can do this as a keycombo with no modifiers,
// i.e. just the letter 'b'.
// 
// When you're using TypeScript, though, you'll need to
// assert that your 'b' has a type of '+b':
const b = new Listenable('b' as '+b')

// This instance will now type check correctly, and the `listen`
// method will know that it's passing a KeyboardEvent to your
// effect function.
b.listen(event => console.log(event))

// The other case to be aware of is when you're listening
// for an unmodified 'rightclick', which Listenable handles
// as if it were a click combo.
//
// Again, just assert that 'rightclick' has a type of '+rightclick',
// and type checking will work properly.
const rightclick = new Listenable('rightclick' as '+rightclick')

// Listenable knows that this event is a MouseEvent.
rightclick.listen(event => console.log(event))
```
:::

The key thing to remember: if you're listening to `rightclick`, or any unmodified keycombo, like `b`, `enter`, `.`, etc., use TypeScript's `as` keyword to make a type assertion, adding a `+` in front of your unmodified character.

This might seem a little strange, and at one point, `Listenable` was actually able to seamlessly detect and type check these unmodified combos with no additional help or assertions from you. However, the strange type assertion workaround _drastically_ increased the performance of `Listenable`'s type checking system, leading to a much better DX during IDE type checking and build time type checking.

At least for now, the slight type unsafety appears to be a worthwhile tradeoff.

Now, moving onto the second case: when you're using `Listenable` to configure a `Recognizeable` instance for recognizing a custom gesture.

Recall that to use `Listenable` with `Recognizeable`, you should pass `recognizeable` as the `Listenable` constructor's `type` argument, and pass your `Recognizeable` instance's options to `listenableOptions.recognizeable`

:::
```js
const instance = new Listenable(
  'recognizeable',
  { recognizeable: { ... } }
)
```
:::

There's a way to write your code so that your `options.recognizeable` object is fully type checked based on all the possible events that you want your `Recognizeable` instance to be able to handle.

We won't cover all that information here, though. Instead, you should visit the [Using with TypeScript section of the `Recognizeable` docs](/docs/logic/classes/Recognizeable#using-with-typescript). Those docs give full information on not only how to set up a standalone `Recognizeable` instance, but more importantly, how to set up a fully type-safe `Listenable` instance that uses `Recognizeable` under the hood to recognize custom gestures.
