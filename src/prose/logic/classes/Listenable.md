`Listenable` is a class that enriches an event type (including observation types, media queries, custom gestures, and more), allowing it to:
- Listen for that event type and execute a callback function when it occurs
- Retrieve a list of active listeners that it has added
- Store a status (`ready`, `listening`, or `stopped`)
- Easily clean up all listening activity to avoid memory leaks


:::
## Example
:::

Baleada's docs use `Listenable` to:
- Toggle the dark theme when you press `Shift` + `D`
- Toggle the minimalist theme when you press `Shift` + `M`
- Set your default theme (dark or light) based on your device's [color theme preference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
- On mobile, open and close the sidebar nav and table of contents when you swipe right or left


:::
## Construct a `Listenable` instance
:::

The `Listenable` constructor accepts two parameters:

::: ariaLabel="Listenable constructor parameters" classes="wide-4"
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | String | yes | The type of event that will be made listenable. See the [Valid event types](#valid-event-types) section for more guidance. |
| `options` | Object | no | Options for the `Listenable` instance. See the [`Listenable` constructor options](#Listenable-constructor-options) section for more guidance. |
:::


:::
### Valid event types
:::

`Listenable` supports a ton of different event types and can deduce which web APIs to use under the hood based on the `type` you pass. 

Most of the time, you don't need to be concerned with exactly which web API is being used, and you can think of it as an implementation detail.

But in certain cases where you want to customize the way a specific web API behaves, you'll need to know which API is being used in order to know what customization options are available.

You'll find more guidance down below, in the [How to customize `listen` behavior](#how-to-customize-listen-behavior) section.

The table below has a breakdown of valid event types, the corresponding web APIs that `Listenable` uses under the hood, and the main purpose of the API.

### How to handle events
:::

Depending on your `type`, your `effect`â€”passed as the required first argument of the `listen` methodâ€”will receive different parameters.

The table below has a full breakdown of what the `listen` method passes to your `effect` for each specific event type:

### How to customize `listen` behavior
:::

The `listen` method accepts an optional second parameter, which is an Object whose properties customize the behavior of the web APIs `Listenable` uses under the hood.

Depending on your `type` only certain properties will have an effect.

First, here's a breakdown of what each `options` property does, and below that, in the [Available options for each `type`](#available-options-for-each-type) section, you'll find a table of which properties can be used for each `type`:

::: ariaLabel="listen method options" class="wide-4"
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `target` | HTMLElement, Document | See description | <p>The target that will listen for events.</p><p>See the [Default values for `target` based on `type`](#default-values-for-target-based-on-type) section for more guidance on default `target` values.</p> |

| `useCapture` | Boolean | none | A value for the standalone `useCapture` parameter of [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). Ignored if an `addEventListener` object was passed. |
| `wantsUntrusted` | Boolean | none | A value for the standalone `wantsUntrusted` parameter of [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) |
| `except` | Array | `[]` | <p>An array of DOM elements that, if they are the target of the event, should *not* cause your `effect` to be executed.</p><p>When the `only` option is a non-empty array, `except` is ignored.</p> |
| `only` | Array | `[]` | <p>An array of DOM elements that, if they are the target of the event, *should* cause your `effect` to be executed.</p><p>When `only` is a non-empty array, `except` is ignored.</p><p>An empty `only` array is ignored (otherwise, the `effect` would never execute).</p> |
| `observer` | Object | none | The `options` parameter of the [Intersection Observer constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver) |
| `observe` | Object | none | The `options` parameter of the [`MutationObserver.observe`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver/observe) and [`ResizeObserver.observe`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver/observe) methods |

### How to listen for custom gestures
:::

`Listenable` allows you to listen for custom gestures defined by Baleada Logic's `Recognizeable` class.

Before you read any further, it's worth checking out the usage docs for these gestures that Baleada supports out of the box:
- [`keychord`](/docs/logic/factories/keychord)
- [`keypress`](/docs/logic/factories/keypress)
- [`keyrelease`](/docs/logic/factories/keyrelease)
- [`mousepress`](/docs/logic/factories/mousepress)
- [`mouserelease`](/docs/logic/factories/mouserelease)
- [`touchpress`](/docs/logic/factories/touchpress)
- [`touchrelease`](/docs/logic/factories/touchrelease)
- [`touchrotate`](/docs/logic/factories/touchrotate)

Those docs will show you the overall workflow for using `Listenable`, with `Recognizeable` under the hood, to recognize complex gestures.

If you get a better understanding of that system and want to define a gesture of your own, definitely visit [the `Recognizeable` docs](/docs/logic/classes/recognizeable) for more guidance.


:::
## Using with TypeScript
:::

`Listenable` will type check your `listen` method `effect` functions and options based on the `type` (String) you pass to the constructor:

:::
```ts
const instance = new Listenable('intersect')

instance.listen(
  // Listenable infers from the `intersect` event type that
  // `entries` is an array of IntersectionObserverEntry objects.
  //
  // entries[0].boundingClientRect.width is correctly typed
  // as a number, automatically!
  entries => console.log(entries[0].boundingClientRect.width),
  // Listenable also knows that the `listen` method for an
  // 'intersect' type can accept an `observer` option,
  // passing an IntersectionObserverInit object.
  { observer: { threshold: 0.5 } }
) 
```
:::

Even complex types like media queries will be detected:

:::
```ts
const screenSize = new Listenable('(min-width: 420px)')
screenSize.listen(
  // TypeScript knows that this is a MediaQueryListEvent
  event => doSomething(event)
)
```
:::

There's one situation where you'll need to adopt a _little_ bit of type unsafety: when using `Listenable` to configure a `Recognizeable` instance for recognizing a custom gesture.

Recall that to use `Listenable` with `Recognizeable`, you should pass `recognizeable` as the `Listenable` constructor's `type` argument, and pass your `Recognizeable` instance's options to `listenableOptions.recognizeable`

:::
```js
const instance = new Listenable(
  'recognizeable',
  { recognizeable: { ... } }
)
```
:::

There's a way to type-annotate your code so that your `options.recognizeable` object is fully type checked based on all the possible events that you want your `Recognizeable` instance to be able to handle, and type unsafety is minimized.

We won't cover all that information here, though. Instead, you should visit the [Using with TypeScript section of the `Recognizeable` docs](/docs/logic/classes/Recognizeable#using-with-typescript). Those docs give full information on not only how to set up a standalone `Recognizeable` instance, but more importantly, how to set up a fully type-safe `Listenable` instance that uses `Recognizeable` under the hood to recognize custom gestures.
