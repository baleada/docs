`Recognizeable` is a class that enriches a sequence of DOM events, allowing it to:
- Recognize itself as something more abstract, like a "swipe" gesture, a user's complex workflow, or a double-tap
- Store metadata about itself
- Store a status (`'ready'`, `recognizing'`, `recognized'`, or `denied'`)


::: type="warning"
`Recognizeable` is a lower-level tool designed to allow the [`Listenable`](/docs/logic/classes/Listenable) class to listen for custom gestures and sequences of events.

Before using `Recognizeable` to define your own custom gesture, you should test out [Baleada Recognizeable Effects](/docs/recognizeable-effects), a collection of pre-made `Recognizeable` configurations that allow `Listenable` to listen for common gestures like swipe, pan, drag-and-drop, double-tap, double-click, and more.

If Baleada Recognizeable Effects doesn't suit your needs, feel free to continue learning about `Recognizeable` so you can define your own custom gestures!

## Construct a `Recognizeable` instance
:::

To construct a `Recognizeable` instance (Object), use the `Recognizeable` constructor, which accepts two parameters:

::: ariaLabel="Recognizeable constructor parameters" classes="wide-4"
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sequence` | Array | yes | <p>Passes the event sequence (Array) that will be made recognizable.</p><p>In all intended use cases, `Listenable` will be constructing the `Recognizeable` instance for you, and it will pass an empty array here.</p> |
| `options` | Object | no | <p>Passes options for the `Recognizeable` instance. See the [`Recognizeable` constructor options](#Recognizeable-constructor-options) section for more guidance.</p><p>This is where `Listenable` delivers the options object you pass to `Listenable`'s `recognizeable` option.</p> |
:::


:::
```js
const instance = new Recognizeable(sequence[, options])
```
:::

Or, if you're using [Baleada Composition](/docs/composition):

:::
```js
const reactiveInstance = useRecognizeable(sequence[, options])
```
:::



:::
### `Recognizeable` constructor options
:::

::: ariaLabel="Recognizeable constructor options" classes="wide-4"
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `effects` | Object, Function | `0` | <p>The object that contains the side effect functions that help recognize your custom sequence.</p><p>`effects` can also be a function that returns an array of tuples that define your effects, but this format is only necessary if you want TypeScript support.</p><p>See the [How to format effects](#how-to-format-effects) section for more guidance on formatting the `effects` object.</p> |
| `maxSequenceLength` | Number, Boolean | `true` | <p>Indicates the number of events that should be stored in the `sequence` array. When a new event is received, `Recognizeable` removes the first event in the `sequence` if its length would otherwise exceed `maxSequenceLength`.</p><p>Set `maxSequenceLength` to `true` if you don't want to limit the number of events that are stored.</p> |
:::


:::
#### How to format effects
:::

`effects` can be an Object or a Function. We'll look at the Function format in a bit, but let's start with the Object.

When `effects` is an Object, its properties should be [valid `Listenable` event types](/docs/logic/classes/Listenable#valid-event-types).


:::
```js
const instance = new Recognizeable(
  [],
  {
    effects: {
      click: ...,
      intersect: ...,
      'shift+cmd+b': ...,
    }
  }
)
```
:::

The value for each property should be an "effect": a function designed to handle incoming items in your sequence. Your `Recognizeable` instance will pass one argument to those functions: the Effect API object.

:::
```js
const instance = new Recognizeable(
  [],
  {
    effects: {
      click: effectApi => {
        // handle mouse event
      },
      intersect: effectApi => {
        // handle Intersection Observer entries
      },
      'shift+cmd+b': effectApi => {
        // handle keyboard event
      },
    }
  }
)
```
:::

Here's a breakdown of the Effect API object:

::: ariaLabel="Effect API breakdown" classes="wide-1 wide-3 wide-4 wide-5"
| Property | Type | Description | Parameters | Return value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sequenceItem` | Event | The sequence item (e.g. click event, array of Intersection Observer entries, etc.) that just occurred | N/A | N/A |
| `getSequence()` | Function | <p>Gets the current `sequence` from the `Recognizeable` instance (including the most recent `sequenceItem` at the end).</p><p>See the [Access state and methods](#access-state-and-methods) section for more info about `sequence`.</p> | none | The `Recognizeable` instance's `sequence` |
| `getStatus()` | Function | <p>Gets the current `status` from the `Recognizeable` instance.</p><p>See the [Access state and methods](#access-state-and-methods) section for more info about `status`.</p> | none | The `Recognizeable` instance's `status` |
| `getMetadata()` | Function | <p>Gets the current `metadata` from the `Recognizeable` instance.</p><p>This `metadata` object is mutable, and any changes to it will directly affect the `Recognizeable` instance's `metadata` property.</p><p>See the [Access state and methods](#access-state-and-methods) section for more info about `metadata`.</p> | none | The `Recognizeable` instance's `metadata` object |
| `setMetadata(metadata)` | Function | Replaces the entire `metadata` object with a new one. | The new `metadata` | none |
| `recognized()` | Function | <p>Sets the `Recognizeable` instance's `status` to `recognized'`, and updates the `sequence` to include the most recent event.</p><p>You should _only_ call this function after the information you've gathered from events and stored in `metadata` proves that your custom gesture has occurred.</p> | none | none |
| `denied()` | Function | <p>Sets the `Recognizeable` instance's `status` to `denied'`, resets the instance's `metadata` to an empty object, and resets the instance's `sequence` to an empty array.</p><p>You should _only_ call this function after the information you've gathered from events and stored in `metadata` proves that your custom gesture can't possibly occur, and everything should reset so you can start recognizing again with a clean slate.</p> | none | none |
:::

You can use that API to extract information from each item in the sequence, store it in `metadata`, and decide when the sequence has been recognized.

:::
```js
const instance = new Recognizeable(
  [],
  {
    effects: {
      click: effectApi => {
        const { sequenceItem, getMetadata, recognized } = effectApi,
              metadata = getMetadata(),
              { clientX, clientY } = sequenceItem

        metadata.lastClickPosition = {
          x: clientX,
          y: clientY,
        }

        if (metadata.lastClickPosition.x === 420 && metadata.lastClickPosition.y === 420) {
          recognized()
        }
      },
      intersect: effectApi => ...,
      'shift+cmd+b': effectApi => ...,
    }
  }
)
```
:::

That's a lot of information to throw at you! If this is your first read through, you should be confused at this point. Don't sweat itâ€”later on, the [Effect workflow](#effect-workflow) section should give more clarity.

Before we move onto the next section, let's mention the Function format for `effects`.

Instead of defining `effects` as an Object with key/value pairs defining what sequence items will be handled, and how to handle them, you can define `effects` as a Function that returns an array of tuples.

In each tuple, the first item should be a [valid `Listenable` event type](/docs/logic/classes/Listenable#valid-event-types), and the second item should be the side effect function that receives the Effect API as its only argument.

:::
```js
const instance = new Recognizeable(
  [],
  {
    effects: () => [
      ['click', effectApi => ...],
      ['intersect', effectApi => ...],
      ['shift+cmd+b', effectApi => ...],
    ]
  }
)
```
:::

This `effects` format is designed for better TypeScript support. It's generally not useful if you're not using TypeScript and don't require type checking.

For more info on this Function format, and how it provides better type checking, see the [Using with TypeScript](#using-with-typescript) section.


:::
## Access state and methods
:::

The constructed `Recognizeable` instance is an Object, and state and methods can be accessed via its properties:


::: ariaLabel="Recognizeable state and methods" classes="wide-3 wide-5"
| Property | Type | Description | Parameters | Return value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sequence` | Getter/Setter | See return value | N/A | <p>The `sequence` array passed to the constructor.</p><p>If you assign a value directly to `sequence`, a setter will pass the new value to `setSequence`.</p> |
| `status` | Getter | See return value | N/A | Indicates the current status (String) of the `Recognizeable` instance. See the [How methods affect status](#how-methods-affect-status) section for more information. |
| `metadata` | Getter | See return value | N/A | An object where you can access any metadata stored by the side effect functions passed to the `effects` option. |
| `setSequence(sequence)` | Function | Sets the `sequence` | The new sequence | The `Recognizeable` instance |
| `recognize(sequenceItem)` | Function |  | <p>An event, array of observer entries, etc.</p><p></p> | The `Recognizeable` instance |

:::


:::
### How methods affect status
:::

Each `Recognizeable` instance maintains a `status` property that allows it to take appropriate action after after your `effects` process a new event received by the `recognize` method.

At any given time, `status` will always be one (and only one) of the following values:
- `ready'`
- `recognizing'`
- `recognized'`
- `denied'`

`Recognizeable`'s status is predictable:
1. After the instance is constructed, `status` will be `ready`.
2. Any time the `recognize` method is called, `status` switches to `recognizing` before the new event is passed to your event effects.
3. `status` remains `recognizing` until one of your effects calls the `recognized` or `denied` functions in the [Effect API](#how-to-format-effects), at which point `status` becomes `recognized` or `denied` (depending on which function your effect called).


::: type="info"
All methods always return the `Recognizeable` instance (i.e. `this`), regardless of `status`.
:::


:::
## Effect workflow
:::

Now that all of `Recognizeable`'s state and methods have been defined and you've finished drowning in the Effect API breakdown, it's time to learn more about `Recognizeable`'s effect workflow.

Here's what the workflow looks like:
1. A sequence item gets passed to the `recognize` method.
2. Internally, the `recognize` method deduces the type of that sequence item.
3. The `recognize` method looks through its `effects` (passed to the constructor option) to finds the effect that matches the deduced event type.
4. `recognize` calls that effect function, passing the Effect API (which includes the original sequence item).
5. Your effect function should extract some information from the Effect API. In most cases, this information will be extracted from `effectApi.sequenceItem`. For example: at what `x` and `y` coordinates did a `mousedown` take place? At what time did the `keydown` happen? According to the latest `ResizeObserver` entry, what's the new width of a certain element?
6. Your effect function can use the Effect API's `getMetadata` function to access the `Recognizeable` instance's `metadata` object. To store your extracted information, you can freely assign values to the properties of that object.
7. Based on all of the information you've gathered, your effect should make a decision: 
    - Has the custom gesture or sequence been recognized? If so, call the `recognized` function. `Recognizeable` will update its status to `recognized`.
    - Still not sure, and need to wait for more events? Do nothingâ€”`Recognizeable` will keep its status as `recognizing`.
    - Final option: did something happen that makes your custom gesture or sequence impossible (e.g. a `mouseup` event when you're trying to recognize a drag/pan gesture)? If so, call the `denied` function to explicitly deny the sequence. `Recognizeable` will update its status to `denied`.

::: type="info"
Still not sure how to use this workflow to recognize your custom gestures? If you're up for a source dive, you can [check out the Baleada Recognizeable Effects source code](https://github.com/baleada/recognizeable-effects) for inspiration.

## Using with TypeScript
:::

`Recognizeable` is designed to provide robust autocomplete and type checking, especially inside your `effects` functions, on the instance's `recognize` method, in the instance's `metadata` property.

Let's dive right into an annotated code example to see how TypeScript support works:

:::
```ts
// Pass a union type to `Recognizeable`'s first generic type
// to tell the instance what types of events it's allowed to
// recognize. Any valid `Listenable` event type is supported.
//
// Use the second generic type to define the shape of the 
// instance's `metadata` property.
type MyTypes = 'mousedown' | 'intersect' | 'cmd+shift+b'
type MyMetadata = {
  x: number,
  y: number,
}
const instance = new Recognizeable<MyTypes, MyMetadata>(
  // This sequence will automatically have a type of:
  // (MouseEvent | IntersectionObserverEntry[] | KeyboardEvent)[]
  [],
  {
    // Use the Function format for options.effects, returning an
    // array of tuples describing your side effects.
    //
    // Your Function will receive a `defineEffect` helper function
    // as its only argument.
    effects: defineEffect => [
      // `defineEffect` accepts an event type as its first parameter,
      // and a side effect function as its second parameter.
      //
      // `defineEffect` uses type inference on the first parameter
      // to type check and autocomplete your side effect.
      //
      // `defineEffect` returns your [type, effect] tuple.
      defineEffect(
        'mousedown',
        ({ sequenceItem, getMetadata() }) => {
          // `sequenceItem` is correctly type checked and
          // autocompleted as a MouseEvent.
          console.log(sequenceItem)

          const metadata = getMetadata()

          // TypeScript knows the shape of `metadata` here. It will
          // autocomplete `metadata` and allow you to do this
          // assignment.
          metadata.x = sequenceItem.clientX
          metadata.y = sequenceItem.clientY
        },
      ),
      defineEffect(
        'intersect',
        ({ sequenceItem }) => {
          // `sequenceItem` is correctly type checked and
          // autocompleted as an array of Intersection Observer
          // entries.
          console.log(sequenceItem)
        },
      )
      defineEffect(
        'cmd+shift+b',
        ({ sequenceItem, getMetadata() }) => {
          // `sequenceItem` is correctly type checked and
          // autocompleted as a KeyboardEvent.
          console.log(sequenceItem)

          // TypeScript knows the shape of `metadata`here. It will
          // throw a type error, because `metadata` doesn't have a
          // `key` property.
          metadata.key = sequenceItem.key
        },
      ),
      // TypeScript will throw a type error here! `pointerdown`
      // is not included in the union we passed to the instance's
      // first generic type.
      defineEffect('pointerdown', () => ...),
    ]{
      click: 
    },
  }
)

// TypeScript will allow you to pass MouseEvents, KeyboardEvents,
// and IntersectionObserverEntry[] arrays to the `recognize` method.
instance.recognize(new MouseEvent('click'))
instance.recognize(new KeyboardEvent('keydown'))

// TypeScript will not allow you to pass other events.
// This will throw a type error!
instance.recognize(new TouchEvent('touchstart'))

// TypeScript knows the shape of `metadata`, and will type check
// this assignment.
const myVariable: number = instance.metadata.x
```
:::

Let's review a few key details from that code.

**The `Recognizeable` constructor accepts two generic types**. Use the first type to define which [valid `Listenable` event types](/docs/logic/classes/Listenable#valid-event-types) can be recognized by the instance. Use the second type to define the shape of `Recognizeable.metadata`.

**Use the Function format for `options.effects`**. Your function should return an array of tuples. In each tuple, the first item should be one of the event types from your instance's first generic type, and the second item should be the side effect function.

**Use `defineEffect` to build your effect tuples**. Your `options.effects` function receives a `defineEffect` helper function as its only argument. `defineEffect` accepts one of your event types as its first argument, and your side effect function as its second argument. It provides great type checking for your side effect, and it returns your tuple.

:::
```ts
const instance = new Recognizeable<...>(
  [],
  {
    effects: defineEffect => [
      // Don't define tuples manuallyâ€”just make an array
      // with a bunch of `defineEffect` calls for each item.
      defineEffect(...),
      defineEffect(...),
      defineEffect(...),
      defineEffect(...),
    ]
  }
)
```
:::

Finally, be aware that all of these same principles apply when you're using `Recognizeable` with `Listenable`, which is what you'll be doing in pretty much every use case.

Here's an annotated code example of using `Recognizeable` via `Listenable`:

:::
```ts
// Pass a union type to Listenable's first generic type
// to tell the instance what types of events it's allowed to
// listen for.
//
// Use Listenable's second generic type to define the shape of the 
// `metadata` for the Recognizeable instance that Listenable
// will construct internally.
type MyTypes = 'mousedown' | 'intersect' | 'cmd+shift+b'
type MyMetadata = {
  x: number,
  y: number,
}
const instance = new Listenable<MyTypes, MyMetadata>(
  // Assert that the string 'recognizeable' is compatible with your
  // type union. This of course is not type safe, but it's a
  // small tradeoff that was made to simplify Listenable's inner
  // workings and public-facing API.
  'recognizeable' as MyTypes,
  {
    // Use options.recognizeable to pass your Recognizeable options
    recognizeable: {
      // Pass a Function to options.recognizeable.effects
      effects: defineEffect => [
        defineEffect(
          'mousedown',
          // effectApi.sequenceItem will now be type checked
          // and autocompleted as a MouseEvent, just like
          // it would be when you're constructing a normal
          // Recognizeable instance.
          ({ sequenceItem }) => console.log(sequenceItem)
        ),
        defineEffect(...),
        defineEffect(...),
      ]
    }
  }
)

instance.listen(() => {
  // In your Listenable.listen callbacks, you can access
  // Recognizeable metadata via your Listenable instance's
  // `recognizeable` property.
  //
  // Listenable.recognizeable.metadata will be aware of
  // the shape of your Recognizeable metadata, and it will
  // type check and autocomplete accordingly.
  const x: number = instance.recognizeable.metadata.x
})
```
:::

Again, let's review a few key details from that code.

**The `Listenable` constructor accepts two generic types**. Use the first type to define which [valid `Listenable` event types](/docs/logic/classes/Listenable#valid-event-types) can be listened to by the instance. These are also the types that the internal `Recognizeable` instance will be able to recognize. Use the second type to define the shape of `Listenable.recognizeable.metadata`.

**Use the Function format for `options.recognizeable.effects`**. Your function should return an array of tuples, just like it does inside `Recognizeable`'s constructor options.

**Use `defineEffect` to build your effect tuples**. Your `options.recognizeable.effects` function receives the same `defineEffect` helper function, which you can use to create type-safe side effect tuples for `Recognizeable`.

Final tip: use [Baleada Recognizeable Effects](/docs/recognizeable-effects)! It's a library of pre-built `effects` for use in `Listenable` and `Recognizeable`. It also comes with pre-built types for use in construction.

There's much more detail on this in the Baleada Recognizeable Effects docs, but here's a quick example:

:::
```ts
import { touchdrag as pan } from '@baleada/recognizeable-effects'
import type {
  TouchdragTypes as PanTypes,
  TouchdragMetadata as PanMetadata
} from '@baleada/recognizeable-effects'

// Use the imported types to set up your instance
const pan = new Listenable<PanTypes, PanMetadata>(
  'recognizeable' as PanTypes,
  {
    recognizeable: {
      // Call the imported function to create your type-safe
      // side effect functions.
      effects: pan()
    }
  }
)

// Listen for pan gestures, and access useful metadata!
pan.listen(() => {
  const { metadata } = pan.recognizeable
  
  console.log(metadata.velocity)
  console.log(metadata.direction.fromStart)
})
```
