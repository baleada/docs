`Drawable` is a class that enriches a stroke (an array of points as `[x, y, pressure]`), allowing it to:
- Draw additional points on the stroke
- Store a `d` (i.e. a string that can be set to the `d` attribute of an SVG `<path>`), updated automatically after drawing additional points
- Store a status (`ready`, `drawing`, or `drawn`)

::: type="info"
`Drawable` adds very little extra functionality to [`perfect-freehand`](https://www.perfectfreehand.com/). It's intended to be a thin wrapper, simply ensuring that `perfect-freehand` conforms to all of Baleada Logic's API design specs and naming conventions.

## Construct a `Drawable` instance
:::

To construct a `Drawable` instance, use the `Drawable` constructor, which accepts two parameters:

::: ariaLabel="Drawable constructor parameters" classes="wide-4"
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stroke` | Array | yes | An array of points as `[x, y, pressure]`. |
| `options` | Object | no | Passes options for the `Drawable` instance. See the [`Drawable` constructor options](#Drawable-constructor-options) section for more guidance. |

### `Drawable` constructor options
:::

::: ariaLabel="Drawable constructor options" classes="wide-4"
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `toD` | Function | `toD` | <p>A function that, when called, returns a `d` (String) for the `Drawable` instance.</p><p>Defaults to the `toD` function exported from Baleada Logic, which is an adaptation of [the `perfect-freehand` rendering example](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand#rendering).</p><p>Baleada Logic also exports a `toFlattenedD` function, adapted from [the `perfect-freehand` flattening example](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand#flattening), which you can pass to the `toD` option if you want to flatten your strokes.</p> |

## State and methods
:::

::: ariaLabel="Drawable state and methods" classes="wide-3 wide-4 wide-5"
| Property | Type | Description | Parameters | Return value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stroke` | Getter/Setter | See return value | N/A | <p>The `stroke` (Array) passed to the constructor.</p><p>If you assign a value directly to `stroke`, a setter will pass the new value to `setStroke`.</p> |
| `status` | Getter | See return value | N/A | The status (String) of the `Drawable` instance. `status` is `ready` after the instance is constructed, and changes to `drawing` while the instance is drawing and `drawn` after the instance is done drawing. |
| `d` | Getter | See return value | N/A | The `d` (String) generated by the `toD` function passed to the constructor. |
| `toD` | Getter | See return value | N/A | The `toD` (Function) passed to the constructor. |
| `draw(points, options)` | Function | Draws additional points on the stroke. | <p>An array of points as `[x, y, pressure]` and options for the `getStroke` function from `perfect-freehand`.</p><p>See [the `perfect-freehand` docs](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand#options) for more guidance.</p> | The `Drawable` instance |

## API design compliance

::: ariaLabel="Drawable's API design compliance"  classes="wide-1 wide-3"
| Spec | Compliance status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access functionality by constructing an instance | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |
| Constructor accepts two parameters: a piece of state, and an `options` object. | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |
| Constructor does not access the DOM | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |
| Takes the form of a JavaScript Object | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |
| State and methods are accessible through properties of the object | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |
| Methods always return the instance | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |
| Stores the constructor's state in a public getter named after the state's type | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `stroke`  |
| Has a public method you can use to set a new value for that public getter | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `setStroke` |
| Has a setter for that getter so you can assign a new value directly | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |
| Any other public getters that should be set by you in some cases also have setters and `set<Property>` methods | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | none |
| Has at least one additional getter property that you can't (and shouldn't) set directly | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `status`, `d` |
| Has one or more public methods that expose core functionality | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | `fetch`, `get`, `patch`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `abort` |
| Either has no side effects or has side effects that can be cleaned up with a `stop` method | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> |  |
| Uses the sentence template to decide what state type should be accepted by a constructor | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | "A stroke can be drawn." |
| Constructor does not accept options that only customize the behavior of public methods, it allows those options to be passed to the method itself as a parameter. | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | |
| Named after its core action, proper-cased and suffixed with `able` | <BrandApiDesignSpecCheckmark /> | |
