`createAsyncDirectedAcyclicDepthFirstSteps` is a [pipe](/docs/logic/pipes-overview) that asynchronously transforms a [directed acyclic graph](/docs/logic/graph-overview) to depth-first steps through the graph.

Your created `asyncDirectedAcyclicDepthFirstSteps` function is a [generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator) that yields each step separately.
