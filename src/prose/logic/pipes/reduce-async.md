`createReduceAsync` is a pipe that accepts an array as an input, and asynchronously outputs <!--TODO-->.

::: type="info"
`createReduceAsync` is a light wrapper around [`reduce`](https://github.com/RobinMalfait/lazy-collections#reduce) and [`toArray`](https://github.com/RobinMalfait/lazy-collections#toarray) from `lazy-collections`.

If you're sending your array through multiple transformations, prefer using `lazy-collections` directly, to maximize [its benefits](https://alexvipond.dev/blog/im-obsessed-with-lazy-collections).
