`createKeycomboMatch` is a [pipe](/docs/logic/pipes-overview) that transforms a keyboard event to a boolean indicating whether or not the event matches a given [keycombo](/docs/logic/keycombo-overview).


:::
## Create keycombo match
:::

Call `createKeycomboMatch` with these parameters to create your `keycomboMatch` function:

::: ariaLabel="createKeycomboMatch parameters" classes="wide-4"
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `keycombo` | [keycombo](/docs/logic/keycombo-overview) | yes | The keycombo to match. |
| `options` | Object | no | Options to customize the behavior of the `keycomboMatch` function. See the [Options](#options) section for more guidance. |

### Options
:::

::: type="warning"
This section of documentation is WIP. These options are part of a fairly complex, difficult-to-explain system for matching keycombos, and they even allow you match keycombos on international and/or non-standard keyboard layouts.

The defaults for these options will match keycombos on standard US keyboard layouts.
