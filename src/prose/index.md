Honduras' favorite food is the **baleada**â€”a fresh flour tortilla, spread with refried beans, then covered with scrambled eggs, mantequilla, queso seco, avocado, chorizo, etc., and finally, folded in half.

You can't have a baleada without its core ingredients and presentation (tortilla with beans, folded in half), but once those requirements are met, you can combine ingredients that suit your tastebuds.

Anyway, the Baleada you're here for is **a toolkit for building web apps** (and websites). Specifically, Baleada offers these types of tools:
- UI logic
- Composition functions (a.k.a. hooks)
- Components
- Configuration utilities
- More to come ([see roadmap](/docs/roadmap))

Think of these tools as the ingredients in a savory, delectable baleada. You're encouraged to take what you want and sprinkle it into the stack you're already using to build your apps and websites. You're free to take just a few things, but if you're so inclined, you can really pile on the extras!

All of Baleada's tools are listed below, and in the left navigation. Use "Filter by package" to show the packages you're interested in.
