Honduras's favorite food is the **baleada**â€”a fresh flour tortilla, spread with refried beans, then covered with scrambled eggs, mantequilla, queso seco, avocado, or meat, and finally, folded in half.

You can't have a baleada without its core ingredients and presentation (tortilla spread with refried beans and folded in half), but once those requirements are met, you can be creative and combine ingredients that suit your tastebuds.

Anyway, the Baleada you're here for is **a toolkit for building web apps** (and websites). Getting down to brass tacks, Baleada offers the following types of tools:
- UI logic
- Composition functions (a.k.a. hooks)
- Components
- Configuration utilities
- More to come ([see roadmap](/docs/roadmap))

Think of these tools as the ingredients in a savory, delectable baleada. You're encouraged to take what you want and sprinkle it into the stack you're already using to build your apps and websites. You're free to take just a few things, but if you're so inclined, you can really pile on the extras!

All of the tools are listed in the sidebar on the left.
