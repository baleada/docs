In many cases, you can start using Baleada Prose components, and everything will just work.

Sometimes, though, you'll want to:
- Scroll your article to different headings automatically, based on changes in the page's URL
- Set custom default values for the props of all instances of a particular component
- Access data about the current articleâ€”for example, a list of metadata for all rendered `ProseHeading`s, which you can use to build a table of contents.

To support those needs, Baleada Prose exports a `useContext` composition function.

import { useContext } from '@baleada/vue-prose'
