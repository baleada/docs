`ProseArticle` the direct parent of all the Baleada Prose components that you use inside your Markdown. It performs these important tasks:
- It creates space in [Prose's `context`](/docs/prose/creating-and-using-context) for a list of all [`ProseHeading`](/docs/prose/components/heading) contents and [`ProseMedia`](/docs/prose/components/media) contents.
- When the URL is anchored to a specific heading, `ProseArticle` scrolls to the correct heading.
