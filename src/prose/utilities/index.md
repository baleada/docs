Baleada Utilities is a Tailwind plugin designed to add a small library of Tailwind utility classes.

[Here's a demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/baleada-utilities?file=index.html,tailwind.config.js) where you can see them all in action ðŸ¤“


:::
## Installation
:::

:::
```bash
npm install @baleada/tailwind-utilities
```
:::


:::
## Usage
:::

To use Baleada Utilities, include the plugin in the `plugins` array of your Tailwind config:

:::
```js
// tailwind.config.js
const { plugin: utilities } = require('@baleada/tailwind-utilities')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    utilities
  ]
}
```
:::

By default, this will add all available utilities, which fall into these categories:
- **Center** utilities, which make it easy to center elements or their contents, regardless of flex vs. grid, flex direction, etc.
- **Corner** utilities, which make it easy to place elements or their contents in a specific corner, regardless of flex vs. grid, flex direction, etc.
- **Edge** utilities, which make it easy to place elements or their contents in the center of a specific edge, regardless of flex vs. grid, flex direction, etc.
- **Dimension** utilities, which are shorthand for creating elements with the same width and height.
- **Stretch** utilities, which are shorthand for making an element full width or height while setting a max width or height.
- **Gap modifiers**, which are shorthand for setting `gap` on flex and grid containers.

We'll cover those categories and their classes [below](#classes), but first, let's look at how you can configure Baleada Utilities to disable categories of utilities that you don't want.

To do that, call the plugin function with options. The plugin accepts two options:

::: ariaLabel="Baleada Utilities plugin options"
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `only` | Array | `['center', 'corner', 'edge', 'dimension', 'stretch', 'gap modifiers']` | A list of the utility categories that should be included. The default value lists all possible options. |
| `except` | Array | `[]` | A list of the utility categories that should be excluded. `except` overrides `only`. |
:::

Here's a code example of how to use these options:

:::
```js
// tailwind.config.js
const { plugin: utilities } = require('@baleada/tailwind-utilities')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    utilities({
      // Enable only dimension utilities
      only: ['dimension'],
    })
  ]
}
```
:::


:::
## Classes
:::

Utility classes can be divided into these categories:
- **Center** utilities, which make it easy to center elements or their contents, regardless of flex vs. grid, flex direction, etc.
- **Corner** utilities, which make it easy to place elements or their contents in a specific corner, regardless of flex vs. grid, flex direction, etc.
- **Edge** utilities, which make it easy to place elements or their contents in the center of a specific edge, regardless of flex vs. grid, flex direction, etc.
- **Dimension** utilities, which are shorthand for creating elements with the same width and height.
- **Stretch** utilities, which are shorthand for making an element full width or height while setting a max width or height.
- **Gap modifiers**, which are shorthand for setting `gap` on flex and grid containers.

All Baleada Utilities classes have a total specificity of 1, making them easy to override with variants and responsive classes.

### Center
:::

Here's a list of center utilities and their features:

::: ariaLabel="Center utilities and their features"
| Utility class | Features |
| --- | --- |
| `.center-all` | Apply to a `.flex` or `.grid` element to vertically and horizontally center all of its direct children. |
| `.center-all-x` | Apply to a `.flex` or `.grid` element to horizontally center all of its direct children. |
| `.center-all-y` | Apply to a `.flex` or `.grid` element to vertically center all of its direct children. |
| `.center` | <p>Apply to an element to vertically center it within its `.flex` or `.grid` parent.</p><p>Or, apply to an `.absolute` element to center it within its closest positioned ancestor.</p> |
| `.center-x` | <p>Apply to an element to horizontally center it within its `.flex` or `.grid` parent.</p><p>Or, apply to an `.absolute` element to center it horizontally within its closest positioned ancestor.</p> |
| `.center-y` | <p>Apply to an element to vertically center it within its `.flex` or `.grid` parent.</p><p>Or, apply to an `.absolute` element to center it vertically within its closest positioned ancestor.</p> |
:::

::: type="info"
Centering always works as expected, regardless of flex direction.
:::

::: type="info"
As often as possible, center utilities avoid using the `margin` property, so that you can apply positive or negative margins to fine-tune placement as needed.

`margin` is only used to center items horizontally in `.flex` containers, and vertically in `.flex.flex-col` containers.
:::


:::
### Corner
:::

Here's a list of corner utilities and their features:

::: ariaLabel="Corner utilities and their features"
| Utility class | Features |
| --- | --- |
| `.corner-all-<corner>` | <p>Apply to a `.flex` or `.grid` element to place all of its elements in a specific corner.</p><p>Replace `<corner>` with `t-l`, `t-r`, `b-r`, or `b-l`.</p>|
| `.corner-<corner>` | <p>Apply to an element to place it in a specific corner of its `.flex` or `.grid` parent.</p><p>Or, apply to an `.absolute` element to place it in a specific corner of its closest positioned ancestor.</p><p>Replace `<corner>` with `t-l`, `t-r`, `b-r`, or `b-l`.</p> |
:::

::: type="info"
Cornering always works as expected, regardless of flex direction.
:::

::: type="info"
As often as possible, corner utilities avoid using the `margin` property, so that you can apply positive or negative margins to fine-tune placement as needed.

`margin` is only used to align items horizontally in `.flex` containers, and vertically in `.flex.flex-col` containers.
:::


:::
### Edge
:::

Here's a list of edge utilities and their features:

::: ariaLabel="Edge utilities and their features"
| Utility class | Features |
| --- | --- |
| `.edge-all-<side>` | <p>Apply to a `.flex` or `.grid` element to center all of its elements on a specific side.</p><p>Replace `<side>` with `t`, `r`, `b`, or `l`.</p><p>`.edge-all-t` is the equivalent of `.center-all-x`, and `.edge-all-l` is the equivalent of `.center-all-y`.</p> |
| `.edge-<side>` | <p>Apply to an element to center it perfectly on a specific side of its `.flex` or `.grid` parent.</p><p>Or, apply to an `.absolute` element to center it on a specific side of its closest positioned ancestor.</p><p>Replace `<side>` with `t`, `r`, `b`, or `l`.</p><p>`.edge-t` is the equivalent of `.center-x`, and `.edge-l` is the equivalent of `.center-y`.</p> |
:::

::: type="info"
Centering and edge direction always works as expected, regardless of flex direction.
:::

::: type="info"
As often as possible, edge utilities avoid using the `margin` property, so that you can apply positive or negative margins to fine-tune placement as needed.

`margin` is only used to center items horizontally in `.flex` containers, and vertically in `.flex.flex-col` containers.
:::


:::
### Dimension
:::

Dimension utilities are shorthand for creating elements with the same width and height. They also support setting width and height to different values with a single class.

Dimension utilities start with `.d-` and end with any value from your `width` or `height` theme configurations, or any arbitrary value supported by width and height utilities. You can also use `theme.dimension` to configure additional classes and values.

:::
```html
<!-- This div will be exactly 12rem tall and wide. -->
<div class="d-24"></div>
```
:::

Note that `.d-screen` is smartâ€”it will give you a `100vw` width and `100vh` height, using the appropriate unit for each dimension.

Arbitrary values for `.d-` classes support two custom CSS units: `v%` and `cq%`. Under the hood, these units evaluate to `vh`, `vw`, `cqh`, and `cqw` as appropriate:

:::
```html
<!-- This div will be 42vw wide and 42vh tall -->
<div class="d-[42v%]"></div>

<!-- Install @tailwindcss/container-queries for container support -->
<div class="@container">
  <!-- This div will be 42cqw wide and 42cqh tall -->
  <div class="d-[42cq%]"></div>
</div>
```
:::

In arbitrary value classes, you can even use these custom units in `calc()`, like `calc(20cq%-10cq%)`. This would evaluate to a height of `calc(20cqh-10cqh)` and a width of `calc(20cqw-10cqw)`.

However, browsers don't support viewport units and container query units in `calc()` expressions, so this is currently invalid CSS.

One more great feature: you can use dimension utilities as a shorthand to set width and height to different values with a single class. The format is `.d-<width>/<height>`, like this:

:::
```html
<!-- This div will be 6rem wide and 8rem tall. -->
<div class="d-24/32"></div>

<!-- Supports arbitrary values ðŸŽ¯ -->
<div class="d-[42px]/[84px]"></div>
```
:::

To add custom `.d-` classes, you can extend the [`spacing`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing#extending-the-default-spacing-scale), [`height`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/height#customizing-your-theme), or [`width`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width#customizing-your-theme) configs.

Or, you can add a `dimension` key to your `theme` configuration. `dimension` is configured exactly like `spacing`, `width`, and `height`:

:::
```js
// tailwind.config.js
const { plugin: utilities } = require('@baleada/tailwind-utilities')

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    dimension: {
      'custom': '42px', // .d-custom
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    utilities
  ]
}
```
:::


:::
### Stretch
:::

Stretch utilities are shorthand for making an element full width or height while setting a max width or height.

Stretch width utilities start with `.stretch-w-`  and end with any value from your `maxWidth` theme configurations, or any arbitrary value supported by max width. You can also use `theme.stretchWidth` to configure additional classes and values.

Likewise, stretch height utilities start with `.stretch-h-`  and end with any value from your `maxHeight` theme configurations, or any arbitrary value supported by max height. You can also use `theme.stretchHeight` to configure additional classes and values.

:::
```html
<!-- This div will be 100% wide, with a max width of 24rem. -->
<div class="stretch-w-sm"></div>

<!-- This div will be 100% tall, with a max height of 1rem. -->
<div class="stretch-h-4"></div>
```
:::

To add custom `.stretch-w-` classes, you can extend the [`maxWidth`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width) config. Or, you can add a `stretchWidth` key to your `theme` configuration. `stretchWidth` is configured exactly like `maxWidth`:

:::
```js
// tailwind.config.js
const { plugin: utilities } = require('@baleada/tailwind-utilities')

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    stretchWidth: {
      'custom': '42px', // .stretch-w-custom
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    utilities
  ]
}
```
:::

To add custom `.stretch-h-` classes, you can extend the [`maxHeight`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-height) config. Or, you can add a `stretchHeight` key to your `theme` configuration. `stretchHeight` is configured exactly like `maxHeight`:

:::
```js
// tailwind.config.js
const { plugin: utilities } = require('@baleada/tailwind-utilities')

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    stretchHeight: {
      'custom': '42px', // .stretch-h-custom
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    utilities
  ]
}
```
:::


:::
### Gap modifiers
:::

Gap modifiers are shorthand for setting `gap` on flex and grid containers.

Add a `/` to `flex`, `flex-row`, `flex-col`, or `grid`, then add a value from `spacing` or `gap` in your Tailwind config. You can also use arbitrary values in square brackets.

:::
```html
<!-- display: flex; gap: 1.5rem -->
<div class="flex/6"></div>

<!-- display: grid; gap: 1.5rem -->
<div class="grid/6"></div>

<!-- display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1.5rem -->
<div class="flex-col/6"></div>

<!-- display: flex; gap: 42px -->
<div class="flex/[42px]"></div>
```
:::

Note that `.flex-row` and `.flex-col` have been upgraded to set `display: flex` automatically, so you can omit `flex` when using them.

Apart from that change, the built-in `.flex`, `.flex-row`, `.flex-col`, and `.grid` classes work exactly the same. You can still freely use them as standalone classes that don't set any `gap` values.

To add custom gap modifier values, you can extend the [`spacing`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing#extending-the-default-spacing-scale) or [`gap`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/gap#customizing-your-theme) configs.


:::
## Center, corner, and edge limitations
:::

Center, corner, and edge classes check for the presence of `.flex`, `.flex-row`, `.flex-col`, or `.grid` classes so they can figure out the optimal way to place your content. When you have [gap modifiers](#gap-modifiers) enabled, thes utilities also check for the presence of `flex/`, `flex-row/`, `flex-col/`, and `grid/`.

This is a neat solution, but it breaks down in a few cases:
- Responsively changing `display` or `position`, e.g. `flex md:grid` or `relative md:absolute`
- Responsively changing flex direction, e.g. `flex md:flex-row center-all-x`.

In those cases, CSS simply can't keep up with which `display` or `position` value is _actually_ applied, so you'll get unexpected and incorrect results from center, corner, and edge classes.

Notable exceptions are:
- `center-all`, applied to an element that is always `display: flex`
- `center`, applied to a direct child of an element that is always `display: flex`

In those cases, `center-all` and `center` will always work correctly.

To completely solve this problem, you can use JS to swap classes in and out at different screen sizes, instead of relying on CSS media queries to do that work.

An upcoming release of [Baleada Features](/docs/features) will export a `useResponsive` function that can help you do this in Vue projects:

:::
```vue
<template>
  <div
    class="flex center-all-x"
    :class=[flexDirection]
  >...</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { useResponsive } from '@baleada/vue-features'

// Vue will reactively swap out `flex-row` and insert `flex-col`
// when your screen reaches the `md` breakpoint.
const flexDirection = useResponsive('flex-row', { md: 'flex-col' })
</script>
```
:::

This is obviously way more code than the standard Tailwind equivalent, which you can absolutely still do, even with Baleada Utilities installed:

:::
```html
<div class="
  flex flex-row justify-center
  md:flex-col md:justify-start md:items-center
">...</div>
```
:::

The Baleada Utilities plugin **never interferes** with default Tailwind functionality, so these escape hatches are **always available**.

But if you want to avoid the mental gymnastics of row vs. column vs. justify vs. items vs. start vs. center vs. end vs. screen size, a little JS is a small price to pay!


:::
## Using with TypeScript
:::

Baleada Utilities is written in TypeScript and provides full type support for configuration.

When passing options to the plugin function, you'll get type checking automatically.

To type check your dimension, stretch width, or stretch height theme configurations, import the no-op helper functions:

:::
```ts
// @ts-check
// tailwind.config.js
const {
  plugin: utilities,
  defineDimensionConfig
  defineStretchWidthConfig,
  defineStretchHeightConfig,
} = require('@baleada/tailwind-utilities')

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    dimension: defineDimensionConfig({
      // This type checks successfully
      'custom': '42px',
      42: '42px',

      // These are type errors:
      'false': false,
      42: 42,
    }),
    stretchWidth: defineStretchWidthConfig(...),
    stretchHeight: defineStretchHeightConfig(...),
  },
  plugins: [utilities]
}
```
:::


:::
## Apply helper
:::

:::
> `createApply` keeps your CSS-in-JS less complex, much more readable, and truly powered by Tailwind's full feature set.
>
> Use it!
:::

In Tailwind's plugin system, custom utilities and component classes get defined with a CSS-in-JS syntax.

:::
```js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

const myPlugin = plugin(({ addComponents }) => {
  addComponents({
    '.btn': {
      display: 'flex',
      color: 'white',
      backgroundColor: 'rebeccapurple',
    }
  })
})
```
:::

It's a smart, super flexible solution, and it even exposes a `theme` helper to make it easier to pull in values from the user's theme configuration:

:::
```js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

const myPlugin = plugin(({ addComponents, theme }) => {
  addComponents({
    '.btn': {
      display: 'flex',
      color: theme('colors.white'),
      backgroundColor: theme('colors.purple.500'),
    }
  })
})
```
:::

There's one big problem: there's no easy way handle Tailwind classes that actually apply multiple properties under the hood to support certain features.

Transform is the best exampleâ€”Tailwind's transform utilities don't just compile to a plain `transform` property and value. They actually set a bunch of different CSS variables and `transform` values, allowing you to easily combine multiple transformations with separate utility classes:

:::
```css
// Compiled CSS for the `.translate-x-full` class
.translate-x-full {
  --tw-translate-x: 100%;
  transform:
    translate(var(--tw-translate-x), var(--tw-translate-y))
    rotate(var(--tw-rotate))
    skewX(var(--tw-skew-x))
    skewY(var(--tw-skew-y))
    scaleX(var(--tw-scale-x))
    scaleY(var(--tw-scale-y));
}
```
:::

If you want to recreate this in your custom classes, you have to do it with CSS-in-JS manually:

:::
```js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

const myPlugin = plugin(({ addUtilities, theme }) => {
  addUtilities({
    '.center': {
      position: 'absolute',
      top: '50%',
      left: '50%',
      '--tw-translate-x': '-50%',
      '--tw-translate-y': '-50%',
      transform: `
        translate(var(--tw-translate-x), var(--tw-translate-y))
        rotate(var(--tw-rotate))
        skewX(var(--tw-skew-x))
        skewY(var(--tw-skew-y))
        scaleX(var(--tw-scale-x))
        scaleY(var(--tw-scale-y));
      `
    }
  })
})
```
:::

That's rough! There's a better way: use `@apply` to handle it all for you:

:::
```js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

const myPlugin = plugin(({ addUtilities, theme }) => {
  addUtilities({
    '.center': {
      // Write the `@apply` statement as a key, with an empty object
      // as the value.
      '@apply absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2': {}
    }
  })
})
```
:::

This is better, but it still feels a bit clunky, and it would throw errors in any project that configures a [custom class prefix](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#prefix). 

To solve all this, Baleada Utilities exports a `createApply` function, which it also uses under the hood.

:::
```js
const { createApply } = require('@baleada/tailwind-utilities')
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

const myPlugin = plugin(({ addUtilities, theme, config }) => {
  // Use the `config` function from the plugin API to get the
  // user's prefix (if unconfigured, it's an empty string).
  const prefix = config('prefix')
  // Pass the prefix to the `createApply` function to create an `apply`
  // function for this specific Tailwind user's config.
  const apply = createApply(prefix)

  addUtilities({
    // Pass any string of Tailwind classes to `apply`
    '.center': apply(`
      absolute
      top-1/2 left-1/2
      -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2
    `)
  })
})
```
:::

`createApply` keeps your CSS-in-JS less complex, much more readable, and truly powered by Tailwind's full feature set.

Use it!


::: type="warning"
In plugins, `@apply` will still fail if you try to apply a class that doesn't exist, based on your user's configuration.

For example, if the user has fully overridden `theme.colors`, and you try to apply a color that no longer exists, Tailwind will throw compiler errors that won't trace directly back to your plugin.
:::


:::
## Browser support
:::

For center, corner, and edge utilities, you're good to go in [any browser that supports the `:where()` pseudo-selector](https://caniuse.com/css-matches-pseudo).

Dimension and stretch utilities are supported everywhere. Gap modifiers are supported in any browser that supports `gap`.
