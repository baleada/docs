`useElementApi` is the backbone of Baleada Features, publicly exported for use in your own projects! It creates [element API](/docs/features/shared/element-api) objects of various kinds. `useElementApi` is super handy for implementing your own Baleada Features inspired composables, and for doing any work whatsoever with function refs in your app.
