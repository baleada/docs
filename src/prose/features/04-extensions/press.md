`usePress` is an [extension](/docs/features/extensions-overview) that tracks when an element has been pressed or released. It behaves consistently across browsers and devices, and it supports various inputs, including mouse, touch, and keyboard.

Internally, `usePress` uses the [keypress](/docs/logic/factories/keypress), [keyrelease](/docs/logic/factories/keyrelease), [mousepress](/docs/logic/factories/mousepress), [mouserelease](/docs/logic/factories/mouserelease), [touchpress](/docs/logic/factories/touchpress), and [touchrelease](/docs/logic/factories/touchrelease) tools from Baleada Logic, giving you a reactive reference to all of the rich metadata they capture.
