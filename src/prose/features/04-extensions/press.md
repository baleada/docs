`usePress` is an [extension](/docs/features/extensions-overview) that tracks when an element has been pressed or released. It behaves consistently across browsers and devices, and it supports various inputs, including mouse, touch, and keyboard.

`usePress` gives you a reactive reference to all of the rich metadata captured by the [keypress](/docs/logic/factories/keypress), [mousepress](/docs/logic/factories/mousepress), and [touchpress](/docs/logic/factories/touchpress) tools from Baleada Logic, which it uses internally.
