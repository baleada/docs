`useHover` is an [extension](/docs/features/extensions-overview) that tracks when the mouse has entered or left an element. It behaves consistently across browsers and devices.

`useHover` gives you a reactive reference to all of the rich metadata captured by the [hover](/docs/logic/factories/hover) tool from Baleada Logic, which it uses internally.
