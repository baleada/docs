`useLabel` is an extension that connects an element in your user interface (e.g. an `input`) to the element that serves as its accessible label.

In other words, `useLabel` does the following:
- Generates a unique ID for the element that serves as your accessible label, or retrieves a unique ID that you've already assigned to that element
- Assigns the unique ID to the [`aria-labelledby`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-labelledby) property on your element
- Optionally, generates a unique ID for your original element (e.g. an `input`), and assigns that ID to the `for` attribute of your accessible label

::: type="info"
If you're already using `aria-label` to label your element, you don't need a separate labelling element, and you don't need `useLabel`.

## Example
:::

[Source code](https://github.com/baleada/docs/blob/main/src/components/ExampleUseLabel.vue)

<ExampleUseLabel class="with-mt" />


:::
## Create a label
:::

To wire up an accessible label, call the `useLabel` function, which accepts two parameters:

::: ariaLabel="useLabel parameters" classes="wide-4"
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `extendable` | Interface, Ref (HTMLElement) | yes | <p>The return object from a Baleada Features [interface](/docs/features#using-functions), or a reactive reference to an HTML element.</p><p>If you pass an interface object, `useLabel` will set the `aria-labelledby` of the `root` element.</p> |
| `options` | Object | no | Passes customization options. See the next table for more guidance. |
:::

Here's a breakdown of the `useLabel` options:

::: ariaLabel="useLabel options" classes="wide-5"
| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bindsHtmlFor` | Boolean | no | `false` | <p>Indicates whether or not `useLabel` should bind the unique ID of your original element to the `for` attribute of the accessible label.</p><p>If the original element doesn't have an ID, a unique ID will be automatically generated.</p><p>Set `bindsHtmlFor` to `true` when you're labelling an `input`, and you want the end user to be able to click the label element to focus the associated text input, or change the `checked` state the associated checkbox, etc.</p> |
:::

:::
```html
<!-- MyComponent.vue -->
<template>...</template>

<script setup>
import { useTextbox, useLabel } from '@baleada/vue-features'

const textbox = useTextbox(),
      label = useLabel(textbox[, options])
</script>
```

:::
## Use your label
:::

`useLabel` returns `label`â€”an object with tools you can use to wire up an accessible label.

Here's a breakdown of that object:

::: ariaLabel="size breakdown" classes="wide-3"
| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `root` | Object | <p>A [single element API object](/docs/features/shared/element-api).</p><p>`root.ref` should be bound to the element that serves as your accessible label.</p> |
| `id` | Ref (String) | A reactive reference to the unique ID generated by `useLabel`, or the existing ID of your label element if available. |
:::


Here's a more complete example of how to use `useLabel` with any DOM element:

:::
```html
<template>
  <input type="checkbox" ref="input" />
  <!--
    This label needs to be properly connected to the checkbox
    so that assistive technology understands their relationship,
    and so that users can click the label to toggle the checkbox's
    `checked` state.

    To make that work, we'll bind `label.root.ref` to the element's
    `ref` attribute.
  -->
  <label :ref="label.root.ref">Subscribe to newsletter</label>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { useLabel } from '@baleada/vue-features'

// Here, we'll set up a template ref for our input
const input = ref(null)

// Then, we'll pass that reference to `useLabel`,
// and we'll also set the `bindsHtmlFor` option to
// `true` in this case.
//
// With this done, assistive tech will understand
// that it should read our label when describing
// the checkbox.
const label = useLabel(input, { bindsHtmlFor: true })
</script>
```
