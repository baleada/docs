`useDetails` is an extension that connects an element in your user interface (e.g. an `input`) to the element that serves as its accessible details.

In other words, `useDetails` does the following:
- Generates a unique ID for the element that serves as your accessible details, or retrieves a unique ID that you've already assigned to that element
- Assigns the unique ID to the [`aria-details`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-details) property on your element

## Example
:::

[Source code](https://github.com/baleada/docs/blob/main/src/components/ExampleUseDetails.vue)

<ExampleUseDetails class="with-mt" />


:::
## Create details
:::

To wire up accessible details, call the `useDetails` function, which accepts one parameters:

::: ariaDetails="useDetails parameters" classes="wide-4"
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `extendable` | Interface, Ref (HTMLElement) | yes | <p>The return object from a Baleada Features [interface](/docs/features#using-functions), or a reactive reference to an HTML element.</p><p>If you pass an interface object, `useDetails` will set the `aria-details` of the `root` element.</p> |
:::

:::
```html
<!-- MyComponent.vue -->
<template>...</template>

<script>
import { useTextbox, useDetails } from '@baleada/vue-features'

export default {
  setup () {
    const textbox = useTextbox(),
          details = useDetails(textbox[, options])

    return { ... }
  }
}
</script>
```

:::
## Use your details
:::

`useDetails` returns `details`â€”an object with tools you can use to wire up an accessible details.

Here's a breakdown of that object:

::: ariaDetails="size breakdown" classes="wide-3"
| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `root` | Object | <p>A [single element API object](/docs/features/element-api).</p><p>`root.ref` should be bound to the element that serves as your accessible details.</p> |
| `id` | Ref (String) | A reactive reference to the unique ID generated by `useDetails`, or the existing ID of your details element if available. |

Here's a more complete example of how to use `useDetails` with any DOM element:

:::
```html
<template>
  <input type="checkbox" ref="input" />
  <!--
    This details needs to be properly connected to the checkbox
    so that assistive technology understands their relationship.

    To make that work, we'll bind `details.root.ref` to the element's
    `ref` attribute.
  -->
  <p :ref="details.root.ref">Lorem ipsum...</p>
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { useDetails } from '@baleada/vue-features'

export default {
  setup () {
          // Here, we'll set up a template ref for our input
    const input = ref(null),
          // Then, we'll pass that reference to `useDetails`.
          //
          // With this done, assistive tech will understand
          // that it should read our details when describing
          // the checkbox.
          details = useDetails(input)

    return { details, input }
  }
}
</script>
```
