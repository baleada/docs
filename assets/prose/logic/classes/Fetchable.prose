`Fetchable` is a class that enriches a resource (i.e. a URL), allowing it to:
- Asynchronously fetch itself
- Store the response and the response JSON
- Store the status of both the response fetching process and the response JSON updating process

`Fetchable` depends on [`Resolveable`](/docs/logic/classes/Resolveable).

::: type="info"
`Fetchable` adds very little extra functionality to the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch) web API. It's intended to be a thin wrapper, simply ensuring that the `fetch` API conforms to all of Baleada Logic's API design specs and naming conventions.

## Construct a `Fetchable` instance
:::

To construct a `Fetchable` instance (Object), use the `Fetchable` constructor, which takes two parameters:

::: ariaLabel="Fetchable constructor parameters" classes="wide-4"
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `resource` | String | yes | The URL of a resource that will be made fetchable. |
| `options` | Object | no | Passes options for the `Fetchable` instance. See the [`Fetchable` constructor options](#Fetchable-constructor-options) section for more guidance. |
:::


:::
```js
const instance = new Fetchable(resource[, options])
```
:::

Or, if you're using [Baleada Composition](/docs/compositon):

:::
```js
const reactiveInstance = useFetchable(resource[, options])
```
:::

### `Fetchable` constructor options
:::

`Fetchable`'s `options` object currently does not accept any options.

## Access state and methods
:::

The constructed `Fetchable` instance is an Object, and state and methods can be accessed via its properties:

### How methods affect status
:::

Each `Fetchable` instance maintains a `status` property that keeps you informed of what's going on internally. As mentioned above, the value of `status` is an object with a `response` property and a `responseJson` property.

Immediately after the instance is constructed, `status.response` and `status.responseJson` both have a value of `ready`. After you call the `fetch` method, those status will change. Here's a breakdown:

::: ariaLabel="How Fetchable statuses change" classes="wide-2"
| Status property | How it changes after fetching |
| --- | --- |
| `response` | <p>Immediately after the `fetch` method is called, `status.response` will be `fetching`.</p><p>After the resource has been fetched (successfully or unsuccessfully), `status.response` will change to `fetched`, and the `Fetchable` instance will then update its `response` property.</p> |
| `responseJson` | <p>Immediately after the `response` is updated, the `Fetchable` instance will change `status.responseJson` to `updating` and start updating the `responseJson` property.</p><p>After the `responseJson` property has been updated successfully, `status.responseJson` will change to `updated`.</p><p>If there is an error during the process of updating the `responseJson`, `status.responseJson` will change to `errored` instead of `updated`.</p> |
:::

::: type="info"
All methods always return the `Fetchable` instance (i.e. `this`), regardless of `status`.
:::


:::
### How to use asynchronous properties
:::

Your `Fetchable` instance has the following **asynchronous properties**, meaning that the properties retrieve [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) instead of raw data:
- `arrayBuffer`
- `blob`
- `formData`
- `json`
- `text`

These properties mirror the [asynchronous Body interface methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) found on the Response object that the `fetch` API fetches.

To make these Body methods easier to work with, `Fetchable` internally wraps them all in [`Resolveable`](/docs/logic/classes/Resolveable).

Immediately after the `Fetchable` instance is constructed (`status` will be `ready`), each of those asynchronous properties will access a fully constructed `Resolveable` instance, which will also have a `status` of `ready`.

After you call the `Fetchable` instance's `fetch` method—or any of the shorthand methods, e.g. `get`—the `Fetchable` instance will asynchronously fetch data from its resource. After fetching has finished, the `Fetchable` instances `response` property will be updated with a Response object (assuming fetching was successful).

When you access one of the asynchronous properties listed above, you will trigger that property's underlying `Resolveable` instance to asynchronously resolve the Response Body's corresponding Promise-based method.

So, putting that all together, here's how to use `Fetchable` with `async/await` to retrieve the underlying data from a response to an HTTP request:

:::
```js
const fetchable = new Fetchable('https://example.com'),
      fetched = await fetchable.fetch(),
      resolved = await fetched.json,
      json = resolved.response
```
:::

And here's how to do it without `async/await`:

:::
```js
const fetchable = new Fetchable('https://example.com'),
      json = fetchable.fetch()
        .then(fetched => fetched.json)
        .then(resolved => resolved.response)
```
