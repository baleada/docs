`Copiable` is a class that enriches a string by allowing it to:
- Be copied to the clipboard
- Store its status ("ready", "copying", or "copied")

`Copiable` is written in vanilla JS with no dependencies, except for the [Clipboard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard) web API.
