`lastMatch` is a utility function similar to [`lastIndexOf`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/lastIndexOf), except that it matches a regular expression instead of searching for a string.

`lastMatch` takes three arguments:
1. The string that will be searched
1. The regular expression that will be used to find matches
1. The index of the character from which `lastMatch` will start searching

`lastMatch` returns the index of the last match, or `-1` if no matches are found.
