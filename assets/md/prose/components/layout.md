`ProseLayout` is the top-level ancestor for all Baleada Prose components, including `ProseArticle`. It performs these important tasks:
- Gather heading text and links for a table of contents
- Set the default messages and props for all components
- Accept a reactive reference to the URL and make it available to the components that need it
