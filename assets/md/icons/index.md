There are [tons of reasons](http://www.fullstackradio.com/47) to use **true SVG icons** instead of icon fonts. But copy/pasting SVG markup all over your website or app is tedious, not readable, and not maintainable.

If you're using a component framework like Vue, React, or Svelte, the clear solution is to wrap up your SVG icons in reusable components, so that you get all the benefits of SVGs while writing efficient code.

Baleada's icon components do just that! Baleada Icons is a collection of lightweight components that render SVG icons.

::: type="info"
All icons used in the Baleada docs are sourced from Baleada Icons ðŸ˜Ž
:::

Icons are sourced from the following icon sets:
- [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/)
- [Eva Icons](https://akveo.github.io/eva-icons/)
- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.dev/)

Each icon in those sets has a corresponding component for the following frameworks:
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) [WIP]
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) [WIP]

## Available components
:::

Baleada Icons includes a component for each individual icon in the Eva Icons and Simple Icons icon sets.

All components follow a simple naming convention: they start with `Eva`, `Simple`, or `Heroicons` depending on which set they are from, and end with the name of the icon.

Eva icons' names and Heroicons' names are created by removing all hyphens and capitalizing the first letter of each word.

Here are a few examples:

::: ariaLabel="Table of examples showing how Baleada transforms Eva icon names into component names"
| Original icon name | Icon set | Component name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bulb | Eva | `EvaBulb` |
| hard-drive-outline | Eva | `EvaHardDriveOutline` |
| globe-2 | Eva | `EvaGlobe2` |
| globe | Heroicons | `HeroiconsGlobe` |
| emoji-happy | Heroicons | `HeroiconsEmojiHappy` |
| menu-alt-4 | Heroicons | `HeroiconsMenuAlt4` |
:::

Simple icons' names are created by:
1. Removing all spaces, exclamation points, colons, and apostrophes
2. Replacing special characters as indicated in the table below
3. Capitalizing the first letter of each word and **preserving** the original case of other letters in the word

| Special character | Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `.` | Dot |
| `&` | And |
| `+` | Plus |

## Language, compilation, browser support, and dependencies
:::

Baleada Icons is written in modern JavaScript. The icons never have dependencies, but depending on the component framework you're using, additional peer dependencies are required:
