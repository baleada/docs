Baleada Composition is a collection of composition functions (a.k.a. hooks) that accomplish two things:
1. Retrieve **state and methods** from one or more of the <NuxtLink to="/docs/logic">Baleada Logic</NuxtLink> tools
2. Make all of the state **reactive**, using tools from the JavaScript framework of your choice

<NiftyAside type="info">
Baleada's docs, which were built using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), use composition functions for touch detection, animation, navigating arrays, searching docs content, and more ðŸš€
</NiftyAside>

Composition functions are supported for the following frameworks:
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org)
- [React](https://react.org) [WIP]
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) [WIP]

`@baleada/composition` includes a composition function for each individual class in Baleada Logic.

All composition functions follow a simple naming convention: they start with `use` and end with the name of the class.
