Baleada uses [Vite](https://github.com/vuejs/vite) for its documentation. Here's how you can run the docs locally:

Go to your locally downloaded Baleada docs folder:

```bash
cd docs
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or, you can generate a static build of the site, which will output to the `dist` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```
